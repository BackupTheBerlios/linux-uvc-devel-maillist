</I>
In some practical sense at least I think I sort of solved
the problem, with a lot of googling.  Having seen the
idea of gstreamer pipes as used years ago in that
&quot;gst video stream&quot; thing,  I thought there should be a sink
to a virtual webcam, and it turns out there is, something
called v42loopback.

I built this, loaded the kernel module it makes, getting
a /dev/video0, then plugged in the camera, getting a /dev/video1,
and then with some fiddling and guesswork ended up with:

gst-launch v4l2src device=/dev/video1 !
video/x-raw-yuv,width=640,height=480,framerate=20/1 ! v4l2sink
device=/dev/video0

and with this, skype produces good results reading from /dev/video0.

I am still not sure what is happening here, perhaps an expert could explain.
I presume the v4l2src is putting out mjpg format and the second pipe
element forces it to yuv, which is what skype wants.

Could Alexey or some other person say if there still could
be some issue with the webcam that could be fixed so this
would not be necessary?  Also, could they advise on whether
this technique is an acceptable solution?  For example,
I am a little concerned that the v4l2loopback is a kernel module
that  is not distributed and I just causally built it and loaded
it without knowing much about how wise that is. (Maybe knowing
nothing about what is available for these gstreamer pipes
I have missed a more current technique for doing this
sort of thing).  Also, this seems to be doing some
unnecessary work if the webcam can be forced to
serve up the correct pixel format from the beginning.

Thanks.
