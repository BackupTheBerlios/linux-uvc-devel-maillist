You seem to be suggesting some hardware problem or a defect
with the camera?  This seems very unlikely to me: recall the
camera seems to works &quot;out of the box&quot; with cheese, camorama,
xawtv, camstream, guvcview.   Only with skype and in some cases
with luvcview do I get this distorted pattern, which is the same sort
of pattern subjectively that I get when I run the gstreamer pipeline
without the conversion element in it.

I also have now tested in in Windows 7 and it seems to work
fine there &quot;out of the box&quot; as well.

&gt;<i> Can you please attach dmesg with trace, to enable trace you need:
</I>&gt;<i> sudo rmmod uvcvideo &amp;&amp; sudo modprobe uvcvideo trace=0xffff
</I>
Don't know quite what you mean?  dmesg output during
what?   I attached the dmesg output when the camera is
plugged in, followed by two runs of luvcview (the
first two command lines below). I

Except I edited out huge amounts of these lines
throughout (which are very suggestive of a format
mismatch as well):

&quot;uvcvideo: Dropping payload (out of sync).&quot;

&gt;<i> Can you please also try different frame rates with yuv.
</I>
Yes, before, per instruction, I used the default.   But I now
find that lucview gives nice looking results for any frame rate
above 17.

In other words,

 luvcview  -f yuv  -s 320x240  -d /dev/video1 -i 17

does not work, but

 luvcview  -f yuv  -s 320x240  -d /dev/video1 -i 18
 luvcview  -f yuv  -s 320x240  -d /dev/video1 -i 19

etc all do work.


&gt;<i> Your gstreamer workaround probably grubs jpg stream from the cam.
</I>
Yes, in more detail I speculate it goes like this:

I have not yet tried to find the basic API for using webcams, but
I assume the following are true:

1) uvc webcams can produce various streaming output formats
in addition to different frame rates and frame sizes.
2) mine can produce at least two, a yuv kind and a jmpg kind
3) it produces jmpg by default (at least v4l2src puts that out)
4) all modern programs either set the format and then
use the correct one, or take the default, detect it, and
do the right thing
5) skype and luvciew, two old programs not modified for
a long time, do not do this successfully in many, or all, cases.
Skype in particular just takes what it gets and assumes it
is in yuv format.

(Although the luvcview runs from the dmesg seem to
find the camera producing yuv format...)

I will fiddle around with this more myself, to see what
happens in dmesg when skype tries to use the camera
for example.

&gt;<i> The answer to your previous question: IMHO, if you can return this cam,
</I>&gt;<i> do it. UVC should just work.
</I>
Unfortunately it is difficult to return it, there would
be a restocking fee, and I am not even confident that
I would not have similar issues or worse with other
cameras.  So if I can be assured it is reasonably
okay to do things this way, I will just do them this way
for now.

As I understand the concept &quot;UVC should just
work&quot;, that means that if UVC is implemented
totally correctly, then a UVC camera should
&quot;just work&quot;.  But we don't know that UVC is
implemented perfectly in Linux right now.  Again,
camera seems to work with almost all programs
available on Linux, and works in Windows too.

Perhaps the camera is doing something
wrong, but it seems like it could be a
simple miscommunication of format
information easily bypassed with a
small hack.
