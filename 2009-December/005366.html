According to the UVC 1.1 specification, table 4-47, the 
dwMaxPayloadTransferSize field &quot;is set by the device and read only from the 
host&quot;. Your device must ignore the value sent by the host, and send back the 
right value when queried with GET_CUR.

&gt;<i> This is what happens, Please explain is there anything I am missing. When

</I>
That's correct. According to the UVC specification, the device should not copy 
the dwMaxPayloadTransferSize value sent by the host.

&gt;<i> But in case of ISOC alos I do copy and send back the same value during the
</I>&gt;<i> call of GET_CUR. Please explain where am I missing.
</I>
In the isochronous case it works because the driver uses the 
dwMaxPayloadTransferSize to select the alternate setting, and has a workaround 
for devices that return a 0 value.
