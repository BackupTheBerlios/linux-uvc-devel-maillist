<PRE>Hey Laurent,

Thanks for your feedback. I didn't see it at first. :-) It looks like I have some more work to do.

Jake

I've reviewed the patch and sent a reply to the mailing list. Have you 
received it ?

&gt;<i> The problem with latency is the sync between audio and video, also since

</I>&gt;<i> The real problem is the variation in time between frames (frame duration),

</I>&gt;<i> like ktime_get, the frame duration is quite stable (ms)
</I>&gt;<i> 32-32-36-32-32-36-... (3 frames in 100 ms = 30 fps) but the same is not true
</I>&gt;<i> for do_gettimeofday in some multicore processors where the frame duration is
</I>&gt;<i> a bit random, so some players will have a hard time trying to play a video
</I>&gt;<i> with this random frame durations specially when they expect a steady frame
</I>&gt;<i> rate.
</I>&gt;<i> Also non-monotonic based timestamps are subject to big errors in case the
</I>&gt;<i> system time changes, this is especially true if you are running a ntp
</I>&gt;<i> server.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway gstreamer based applications, like totem, don't seem to have
</I>&gt;<i> any problems with random frame duration and xine also seems to work
</I>&gt;<i> without much problems, so the big issue here is the use of a
</I>&gt;<i> non-monotonic timer, that can cause a negative/future timestamps (this
</I>&gt;<i> would break any media player).
</I>
I've discussed the issue with Mauro Carvalho Chehab and Devin Heitmueller, and 
both agree that moving to a monotonic clock is the right solution. However, 
this could break applications that rely on the realtime clock. Testing is thus 
required.

I could easily create a test tree on linuxtv.org, but the issue is to get 
people to test the driver with their applications, as building and using a 
linuxtv.org mercurial tree is rather difficult for many users.

I will thus commit the change to the uvcvideo driver and push that to mainline 
in order to get a bigger user base for testing. I'm pretty confident few 
applications (if any) will break, but to be on the safe side I could add a 
module parameter to select the clock and use the realtime clock by default.

What's the general opinion regarding adding a module parameter for clock 
selection vs. replacing the realtime clock by a monotonic clock completely ? 
Is anyone here concerned about application breakage ?
