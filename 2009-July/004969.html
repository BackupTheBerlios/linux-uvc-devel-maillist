<PRE>Hi,
On manual exposure I believe all logitech UVC cameras support it.
They have a wide range of uvc cameras from the very cheap to the very
expensive, price is very dependent on the quality of the sensor and of the
lens, also if the camera has motorized controls like pan/tilt or focus.
Creative and some other well known brands also have some nice UVC cameras
with exposure control. Actually from what I've encountered in terms of
hardware most uvc cameras support manual exposure, with the exception of
some builtin laptop cameras and a couple of other very cheap cameras :-).

Usually setting exposure control, means selecting the exposure setting from
a menu type control and also in some cases (logitetch at least) disabling
&quot;Exposure, Auto Priority&quot; control.

For IR, just remove the lens ;-), all CCD and cmos sensors are IR sensitive,
the lens usually has a IR filter that blocks it, producing a much better
image. Personally I wouldn't recommend using any camera without at least
some IR filtering, or the image noise can get very high.

Best regards,
Paulo

&gt;<i> Background:
</I>&gt;<i> I have been trying to find a good value low cost webcam for computer vision
</I>&gt;<i> on linux. My basic plan is to set the exposure high enough to max the
</I>&gt;<i> framerate, and use gain to make the markers I'm tracking visible. The
</I>&gt;<i> ugliness resulting from this shouldn't matter. Unfortunately, there seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be no list of what webcams allow you to set the exposure manually, and the
</I>&gt;<i> grab bag of various models I have now all seem to not let you do that. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> looking at trying the Philips SPC 900NC which is said to work with the PWC
</I>&gt;<i> controller, but seems discontinuedish and more expensive than I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> pay... I'm willing to pay for the quality if I need it(and the product has
</I>&gt;<i> it!), but I'm making a system where I'll want to add as many cameras as
</I>&gt;<i> possible, so cheap is good (that's why I'm not going for firewire cameras,
</I>&gt;<i> as much as I would like to).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specific questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.)Is there anything wrong with using  &quot;# v4lctl -c /dev/videoX list&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> check for manual exposure settings? Or could this command miss a camera that
</I>&gt;<i> can do it with just the stock UVC driver? (It'd be helpful to see an example
</I>&gt;<i> of what a camera that can do that would look like as well, eg. what to look
</I>&gt;<i> for.)
</I>&gt;<i> 2.) Is there a list with what cameras do manual exposure? (And what frame
</I>&gt;<i> rates they can actually reach...)
</I>&gt;<i> 3.) If not, should we try to extend the current UVC linux cam list with
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of extra data? Or at least bring this scattered data together in a
</I>&gt;<i> single, if separate, repository? (Perhaps on the wiki...)
</I>&gt;<i> 4.) In the meantime, does anyone have any suggestions? Particularly so if
</I>&gt;<i> you know of a camera that does infra-red out of box or is easy to mod with
</I>&gt;<i> the exposed film trick, as I'd prefer to make the markers subtle to the
</I>&gt;<i> human eye.
</I>&gt;<i> 5.) Some of these questions pertain to this mailing list, let me know if
</I>&gt;<i> some of them don't and where I should take them elsewhere....?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
