First of all, thank you very much for supporting the Linux UVC driver project.

Most webcams are nowadays supported out of the box by the Linux UVC driver. 
Common problems come from

- webcam firmware/hardware bugs that require workarounds in the driver or, 
worse, can't be worked around at all

- multimedia integration in Linux (or lack thereof), and various bug in 
applications that make the user experience rather shaky

Depending on how serious the FW/HW bug is, problems in the first category can 
be fixed remotely or require access to the hardware. I could definitely use 
hardware samples to (try and) fix the most serious ones.

Some cameras also have bugs that can't be easily worked around. For instance, 
I've received reports of webcams that had a bad auto-exposure algorithm that 
got stuck in very low-exposure mode, making the image extremely dark. There's 
not much the host software can do about that.

Fixing application bugs and improving multimedia integration doesn't usually 
require access to every webcam model. What is needed there is a few developers 
with free time and access to a few webcams. Providing hardware samples can 
definitely help.

Obviously, bugs in proprietary applications (such as Skype) can not be fixed 
by open-source developers. The end-user might feel that a particular webcam 
model is &quot;crap because it doesn't work with Skype&quot;, but little can be done 
about that if Skype is at fault.

How many different webcam models do you plan to sell ? Do you plan to perform 
some basic testing yourself and provide hardware samples to developers when 
problems are detected, or would you prefer to donate hardware samples for all 
models to someone who would test them all ?

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
