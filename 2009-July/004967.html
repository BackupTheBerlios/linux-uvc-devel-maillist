<PRE>Background:
I have been trying to find a good value low cost webcam for computer vision
on linux. My basic plan is to set the exposure high enough to max the
framerate, and use gain to make the markers I'm tracking visible. The
ugliness resulting from this shouldn't matter. Unfortunately, there seems to
be no list of what webcams allow you to set the exposure manually, and the
grab bag of various models I have now all seem to not let you do that. I'm
looking at trying the Philips SPC 900NC which is said to work with the PWC
controller, but seems discontinuedish and more expensive than I'd like to
pay... I'm willing to pay for the quality if I need it(and the product has
it!), but I'm making a system where I'll want to add as many cameras as
possible, so cheap is good (that's why I'm not going for firewire cameras,
as much as I would like to).

Specific questions:
1.)Is there anything wrong with using  &quot;# v4lctl -c /dev/videoX list&quot; to
check for manual exposure settings? Or could this command miss a camera that
can do it with just the stock UVC driver? (It'd be helpful to see an example
of what a camera that can do that would look like as well, eg. what to look
for.)
2.) Is there a list with what cameras do manual exposure? (And what frame
rates they can actually reach...)
3.) If not, should we try to extend the current UVC linux cam list with this
kind of extra data? Or at least bring this scattered data together in a
single, if separate, repository? (Perhaps on the wiki...)
4.) In the meantime, does anyone have any suggestions? Particularly so if
you know of a camera that does infra-red out of box or is easy to mod with
the exposed film trick, as I'd prefer to make the markers subtle to the
human eye.
5.) Some of these questions pertain to this mailing list, let me know if
some of them don't and where I should take them elsewhere....?
