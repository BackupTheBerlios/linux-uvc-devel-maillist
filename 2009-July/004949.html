Implementing timestamps support shouldn't be extremely difficult, do you want 
to give it a try ? Many users will be thankful :-)

To be honest, I'm not sure if this would be enough to avoid all audio/video 
sync issues.

Both the audio and the video devices can suffer from data loss. Video frames 
can be corrupted or completely lost, and audio samples can be missed as well. 
To resynchronize the two streams in such a case, you need

1. to timestamp each video and audio sample (or groups of samples), and 
2. to use the timestamps during plyaback

The uvcvideo driver currently uses the system time to timestamp video frames. 
This is not a perfect solution but is probably accurate enough for most 
applications. Implementing timestamps support would provide a better accuracy 
in the timestamp value.

The usbaudio driver doesn't, as far as I know, timestamp audio data. If 
samples are lost, I don't think the driver will notice. You should ask the 
usbaudio developer(s) for confirmation.

As mentioned already in an answer to your mail, you will need to use a 
container that supports timestamps, otherwise the player will not be able to 
resynchronize audio and video.

&gt;<i> I'm working on a more-or-less embedded platform (the prototype

</I>&gt;<i> - record the video with the lowest possible cpu usage - I think a
</I>&gt;<i> direct MJPEG recording from the cam to file should be the best option
</I>&gt;<i> - playback / reencode the video afterwards and get a 'constant wall
</I>&gt;<i> clock speed' video (no problems if it looses frames as long as this is
</I>&gt;<i> accounted for)
</I>&gt;<i> - audio recording in the same file would be a bonus but not needed,
</I>&gt;<i> alsarec is already doing its job
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really need anything else, the system will start recording
</I>&gt;<i> right after boot and keep on until power off. Right now I'm using the
</I>&gt;<i> latest stable kernels from kernel.org, but applying any patch and
</I>&gt;<i> recompiling is not a problem. If possible, I plan to stick to UVC
</I>&gt;<i> cameras with MJPEG support, probably logitech ones.
</I>&gt;<i> Any help would be really appreciated, thanks.
</I>
Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
