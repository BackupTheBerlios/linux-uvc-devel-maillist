Currently ekiga (aka gnomemeeting) have basic support but soon mjpeg format
will be add. I've fixed a color problem yesterday.

because uvcviewer can decode MJPEG et YUYV stream, and not the others. xawtv
support MJPEG stream (the other device that send this stream is the motion
eye; a webcam found in some Sony laptop). MJPEG is not very popular in
software application because not many device return this format, and the many
driver do the conversion in the driver (bad) so not many application have
developped a support for this format.

&gt;<i> Also, i would like to know, if needed, what could be done to further aid the
</I>&gt;<i> development of this project, i am willing to attempt to learn v4l2, and
</I>&gt;<i> relevant USB2 information to possibly help in advancing this project,
</I>
You just need to add support for yet another video format in your favorite
application. I look quickly into mplayer, and not found why he can't decode
the stream.
