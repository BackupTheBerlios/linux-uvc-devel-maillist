<PRE>Hi all, as of late, i have purchased the brand spanking new web cam,
Quickcam pro, finding out in lost hope that it is unsupported by the
traditional drives, my hopes are lifted with this project! :) anyway. I have
compiled all that is needed for the webcam to work, and loaded all the
modules and what not, and can even see myself with uvcview utility. However,
currently, i cannot use it as i intended with aMSN, while at points, tries
to work (indicated by the flickering of the camera, and apparently slow
process) but fails to work. also, xawtv, mplayer, and others also fail to
see the video.

I suppose my question is this, is there any possible way to output the
captured stream of uvcview to another v4l device, so as to provide a more
reliable method of video output. Im sorry if my question is foolish, i am
not well versed in v4l2 or this project. And my C[++] needs updating no
doubt.

Perhaps more clearly, my question is why is it uvcviewer can see it
properly, where as applications using the standard v4l2 cannot, and how, if
possible, can we make the output more standard, as to be seen by the
standard programs, like xawtv, and such.

Also, i would like to know, if needed, what could be done to further aid the
development of this project, i am willing to attempt to learn v4l2, and
relevant USB2 information to possibly help in advancing this project,
although as of now, no promises can be made (working highly odd hours,
unreliable hours really). Also, heh, sorry for this message, as i have spent
the last 12 hours or so working at a computer, my brain is somewhat less
than optimal. so please excuse the poor grammar, punctuation, run on
sentences, etc.

I dont know if dmesg outputs are relevant, but if they are, i shall post
them (didnt want to fill this post with nonsense)

Tanner
