<PRE>Hi, all

Patch definitely is not a solution. I performed a deep investigation of this 
problem. I tested driver on x86 and amd64 architectures with &quot;reply&quot; 
and &quot;reset&quot; patches and without them. As a result I found, that replying 
control message almost doesn't help. At some point camera doesn't acknowledge 
the message and goes to &quot;broken&quot; state. Replying in most cases returns -32 
(-EPIPE) error. Sometimes it can be -75(-EOVERFLOW)  error, which indicates 
a &quot;bubble&quot; situation - in my understanding, camera sends us data, which we 
don't request and don't expect. After -32 or -75 error we will always 
receive -110 (ETIMEDOUT). Hardware not understand us, the only way is to 
reset camera, either by calling usb_reset_device() or by unplugging the cord.

I performed this investigation, using small program, that changes camera 
controls in loop with random values. The -32 error code usually is returned 
after I try to change any control immediately after gamma, white balance or 
exposure controls. Camera need more time to physically apply this controls to 
hardware. So, I think, that we send controls to quickly. Yes, camera must 
acknowledge control packet only after it applied it to hardware. But who 
knows does it do so or not.

The solution may be in a delay between to calls of usb_control_msg(). I'm 
performing this tests now and almost ready to post the patch. Martin and 
Laurent, I need your opinion about this.

Again and again, sorry for my English.  I really hope, that this message is  
readable at least partly 

Regards, Evgeny
