All memory transfer is handled by DMA, leading to little cpu load. The
cameras firewire cameras I use at work do not have any problems with
streaming 3 uncompressed VGA grayscale images at 30 fps over one firewire
bus. Denis McLaughlin reported that the capture is not always steady when he
tries streaming of a similar amount of data using USB2.0 and 4 logitech
fusion cameras at VGA and 15 fps (and he is using MJPEG, which results in
dramatically less bandwidth, 70kB instead of 300kB per frame.). I don't know
if this is a camera or a driver issue though.

Since I need to combine the images into one single image/panorama
afterwards, having synchronized cameras would be best, but I think if the
capture frequency is the same for each camera and stays constant, it is
hopefully possible to do once define the offset in frames for each camera
(relative to one master camera) after the capture.

Thanks a lot for the detailed information! Nice to see that detailed
information is/will be available on the web soon.

I have one more question: I heard that the Quickcam Fusion uses a rolling
shutter (which means that the whole image is not captured at once, but in a
row by row, or similar manner). Is can lead to artefacts for moving objects.
I understand that this is not a problem for the typical webcam user, but for
some applications (mostly for merging multiple images into a panorama or
doing stereo analysis or similar) it is preferable to have a progressive
scan camera (where the whole image is captured at once).

Do you know if logitech manufactures webcams with progressive scan sensors?

ciao
  Pablo
