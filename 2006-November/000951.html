<PRE>Hi Sab,

&gt;<i> &gt; Mplayer is known not to work with the UVC driver. A (simple) bug inside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mplayer still hasn't been fixed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Try to use ekiga or luvcview to check if your webcam works. Then, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mplayer developers to fix the bug.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I was just using mplayer to test as I thought it may
</I>&gt;<i> have a solid V4L2 implementation, apparently I was wrong...
</I>
Mplayer has a good V4L2 implementation, but not good enough for the linux-uvc 
driver.

&gt;<i> Yeah, indeed, luvcview did succeed to initialize the camera.
</I>&gt;<i> Ekiga by itself did not, but after I ran luvcview, Ekiga
</I>&gt;<i> was able use it. But after some experimenting with Ekiga
</I>&gt;<i> (turning cam off and on) sometimes it failed, then I
</I>&gt;<i> reran luvcview and then it started to work again.
</I>
Ekiga is not to blame. Logitech webcams have a hardware bug which prevent them 
from working properly when used with some USB controllers. There's a subtle 
timing issue at the USB stack level which is triggered by Linux only. We 
currently don't know how to work around it.

&gt;<i> The tcl/tk-based MSN client &quot;amsn&quot; also failed to get the
</I>&gt;<i> camera to work, even after it has been initialized with
</I>&gt;<i> luvcview.
</I>
amsn doesn't support V4L2 properly.

&gt;<i> So practically I could not use the camera for anything
</I>&gt;<i> good although it theoretically works. Does this count?
</I>
Now that your webcam works (well, mostly, if you don't take the hardware bug 
into account), your next task will be to get your applications of choice 
fixed :-)

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
