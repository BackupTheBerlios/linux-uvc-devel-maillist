<PRE>Hey Evgeny,

I've given your patches a little testing:

The first patch that spaces the control messages by 500 microseconds does  
very well for me. Keep in mind, though, that on my computer even the retry  
patch works fine, so I'm not sure how meaningful this result is.

The second patch that spaces all URBs is not really satisfying since  
changing any controls now delays video frames resulting in very bad video  
experience.

A few other comments:

&gt;<i> -45 error seems to be related to usbaudio and audio stream capture. The
</I>&gt;<i> solution provided is to resend URB in case of EL2NSYNC error. There are  
</I>&gt;<i> patch for 2.6.19-rc kernels, that fixed this issue. For older kernels we
</I>&gt;<i> have to fix it in driver code.
</I>
I've never seen -45 before, so I'd really be interested in knowing whether  
this occurred while audio was active. Vidar, do you remember?

I would like to run some more tests. Could you please send me the little  
tool you're using to stress test the camera with hundreds of requests per  
second?

&gt;<i> So, I think, that we send controls to quickly. Yes, camera must
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge control packet only after it applied it to hardware. But who
</I>&gt;<i> knows does it do so or not.
</I>
Not necessarily. The camera can acknowledge the control immediately and  
delay the internal processing. In such cases the camera may follow up with  
a status interrupt to signal the completion of the control change but that  
is not required if the SET_CUR request was acked within 10 ms (section  
2.4.4).

Cheers,
Martin
