<PRE>Hi Evgeny,

first of all, thank you for your help. You have spent quite a lot of time to 
try to fix the Logitech hardware issue, and I think I can speak in the name 
of everybody here to thank you for your efforts, even if the perfect patch 
hasn't been found yet :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Are you sure about that ? Could you give more information about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interference you noticed ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Almost sure. I investigate hardware bug, that leads to -32 and -110 error.
</I>&gt;<i> I wrote small program that changes camera controls several hundreds times
</I>&gt;<i> per second. I recieve -32 error after 2-3 seconds of changing controls. As
</I>&gt;<i> you know, I posted small patch, that delays usb_control_msg() for at least
</I>&gt;<i> 500 microseconds after previous control message. With this patch I receive
</I>&gt;<i> -32 error not so often - after 100 - 200 thousands of changes. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> modified driver to delay control message for at least 500 microseconds
</I>&gt;<i> after ANY submitted URB. I never receive -32 nor -110 error anymore. Please
</I>&gt;<i> note, that I perform video capture and manipulations with control in
</I>&gt;<i> different threads.
</I>
I'll try your patch in a few days. My computer isn't affected by the hardware 
bug, so I can't test fixes easily here. My boyfriend has a laptop which 
suffers a lot from the problem, so I can fortunately (for me, not for 
him :-)) test patches on his computer.

&gt;<i> After that, I think that camera hardware have not enough time to apply
</I>&gt;<i> changes when we try  to change controls too quickly. Am I right? Can this
</I>&gt;<i> be true?
</I>
Only the hardware/firmware developers could answer that. What really puzzles 
me is that the webcam works in Windows, and I've been told by Logitech that 
their driver contained no special workaround.

&gt;<i> Also, I noticed strange behavior in VIDIOC_S_CTRL. It always returns zero
</I>&gt;<i> not depending is there an error in uvc_ctrl_commit or not. It looks like a
</I>&gt;<i> typo. Do we need &quot;return ret;&quot; after line 518 in uvc_v4l2.c ?
</I>
You're right. I committed a patch to the split branch which fixes 
VIDIOC_S_CTRL and some other ioctls. Thanks a lot.

&gt;<i> &gt; Isochronous URBs are submitted in interrupt context, so we can't use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mutexes there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about to move submitting to interrupt bottom half?
</I>
I'd like to avoid that if possible. I would like to keep the driver as 
hardware independent as possible, and using a bottom half interrupt handler 
to work around a vendor bug is a big change. We're not even sure yet that it 
would work.

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
