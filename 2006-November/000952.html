<PRE>Hi Jim,

&gt;<i> I have a &quot;Pico iMage Webcam&quot; from Ecamm which is a CCD based UVC
</I>&gt;<i> device. I suspect it is far from being supported in the uvcvideo
</I>&gt;<i> drivers. It works without device specific drivers on Mac OS X and
</I>&gt;<i> allegedly Windows XP so it seems they have followed the spec in some
</I>&gt;<i> manner.
</I>
That's interesting. The linux-uvc project aims at supporting all UVC compliant 
webcams, so I'm definitely interested in investigating your problems.

&gt;<i> Problems so far:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The frame format descriptor is in the endpoint instead of the
</I>&gt;<i> interface. I patched to look both places.
</I>
That's not very UVC-compliant. Could you send me a complete device descriptor 
dump ? As lsusb might not print all information, please send me the content 
of /proc/bus/usb/&lt;bus number&gt;/&lt;device number&gt; as well.

&gt;<i> 2) The probe fails. I naively skip the probe.
</I>
How does it fail ? Can you give me more information ?

&gt;<i> 3) There are no isochronous endpoints. The only endpoint is Video
</I>&gt;<i> Streaming endpoint for 512 byte bulk data.
</I>
That's a known issue. UVC devices can use either isochronous or bulk 
transfers. As the only cameras I own or can easily get access to implement 
isochronous transfers only, I haven't been able to add support for bulk 
transfers.

&gt;<i> At this point I'm guessing it will take 100+ lines of code to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with this camera and is better left to the driver writers.
</I>
You could have a try :-) Support for bulk transfers is an important feature.

&gt;<i> I'll switch to one of the supported logitech models. Though my first
</I>&gt;<i> camera didn't work, I have to say it is nice to have a driver working
</I>&gt;<i> from a documented camera API after all the time I've spent playing
</I>&gt;<i> driver roulette with the various reverse engineered webcam drivers
</I>&gt;<i> for linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If one of the active driver writers would like this camera for coding
</I>&gt;<i> and they aren't someplace too expensive for me to ship from the usa
</I>&gt;<i> then they should send me an email and an address and I'll send them
</I>&gt;<i> the camera.
</I>
That's very nice of you. I live in Belgium, how expensive would it be to send 
it here ?

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
