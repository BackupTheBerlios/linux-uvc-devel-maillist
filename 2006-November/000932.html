<PRE>Hey Pablo,

&gt;<i> The YUV mode definitely leads to a huge amount of data in that case. (if  
</I>&gt;<i> 15 or 30 fps is desired). With a firewire camera at least the capture  
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be a problem (no copying involved, all data transfered via DMA)
</I>
How is Firewire different from USB in this case?

&gt;<i> saving to disk probably is the killer there. At first I'm looking at  
</I>&gt;<i> dumping the
</I>&gt;<i> images right to disk.
</I>
Likely, but a RAID could certainly handle this.

&gt;<i> So a camera with MJPEG output would be definitely a nice thing to have,
</I>&gt;<i> because it would probably lead to a manageable amount of data.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, I would like to know a bit more about the capabilities of  
</I>&gt;<i> the recent logitech webcams before I buy one, just to find that it  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't do
</I>&gt;<i> the things I need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MJPEG support is good news, but there is not information on the web for  
</I>&gt;<i> with resolution and framerates it is supported.
</I>&gt;<i> All information from logitech is just marketing bubbles, no hard facts
</I>&gt;<i> there, like which mode is available at what image size and frame rate.
</I>
I work for Logitech, so feel free to bring on criticism ... :-)

Yes, we know that it's not exactly easy to get detailed information, but
the good news is that we're working on it! We're currently setting up a
server that will host, among other things, a website with just this kind
of details. I've attached an extract. It's a list of supported frame
rates, I think that's what you're looking for. Please keep in mind that it
has some data that still needs to be checked.

&gt;<i> The only thing I found out is that the Fusion doesn't support more than  
</I>&gt;<i> 7.5 fps in its highest resolution (in RGB24 mode?):
</I>
True, see attachment. Just to be clear: There is no RGB24 mode in the
camera. The camera only knows YUY2 (YUYV) and MJPEG. RGB24 is emulated by
the driver on Windows and so is I420.

Cheers,
Martin
