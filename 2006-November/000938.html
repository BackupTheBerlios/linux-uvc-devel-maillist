<PRE>I have a &quot;Pico iMage Webcam&quot; from Ecamm which is a CCD based UVC  
device. I suspect it is far from being supported in the uvcvideo  
drivers. It works without device specific drivers on Mac OS X and  
allegedly Windows XP so it seems they have followed the spec in some  
manner.

Problems so far:

1) The frame format descriptor is in the endpoint instead of the  
interface. I patched to look both places.
2) The probe fails. I naively skip the probe.
3) There are no isochronous endpoints. The only endpoint is Video  
Streaming endpoint for 512 byte bulk data.

At this point I'm guessing it will take 100+ lines of code to deal  
with this camera and is better left to the driver writers.

I'll switch to one of the supported logitech models. Though my first  
camera didn't work, I have to say it is nice to have a driver working  
from a documented camera API after all the time I've spent playing  
driver roulette with the various reverse engineered webcam drivers  
for linux.

If one of the active driver writers would like this camera for coding  
and they aren't someplace too expensive for me to ship from the usa  
then they should send me an email and an address and I'll send them  
the camera.
