<PRE>&gt;<i> Using Lucview's reset button worked unexpectedly!
</I>&gt;<i> OK, it resetted the Picture setting ok.
</I>&gt;<i> It moved Pan / Tilt to its extreme positions, but while doing this a bad  
</I>&gt;<i> sound came out of my cam and Tilt didnt come up to its middle again while
</I>&gt;<i> pan did.
</I>&gt;<i> Shock!
</I>
Is it still stuck? I've attached below an entry of the FAQ I'm about to  
prepare ...

&gt;<i> I tried pan / tilt control from luvcview but only pan worked...
</I>
There are different versions of the driver and different versions of  
luvcview that don't always work together because at some point the control  
IDs changed. Can you try to recompile the latest luvcview and make sure  
that its control IDs are the same as in your driver?

&gt;<i> I tried all things of unplugging cam, reloading module, etc. but Tilt  
</I>&gt;<i> control was dead, and so was the reset button.
</I>
Did the tilt control ever work? (Tilt during the reset process doesn't  
count because that's controlled by the camera.)

Cheers,
Martin



=== The panning mechanism of my camera got stuck. How do I fix it? ===

There are different ways to resolve this problem. You should try the  
following points:

# Try to use the ''Pan/tilt reset'' control to reset the position of the  
camera head.
# Plug the camera into a Windows machine that has Logitech QuickCam  
installed. This should automatically reset the pan/tilt position.
# If none of the above work, you may need to carefully turn the camera  
head manually by different angles.
