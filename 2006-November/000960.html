<PRE>Hi Laurent,

  is this problem limited to camera initialization? If so, soft or hard reset would
work for me, at least temporarily. I had USB2.0 camera initialization problems
under Windows and hardware hack to toggle the power to the camera solved
the problem.

Regards,
Paul.


Hi Paul,

&gt;<i> is there a USB controller, which does not have this problem? Is there a way
</I>&gt;<i> of using UVC API (just my custom application and embedded version of Linux)
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid this problem?
</I>
I've always suffered from the problem, more often with some controllers than 
others. Unfortunately, there is no way to know how good (or how bad) your 
webcam will work with your controller short of trying.

Martin will soon post a simple workaround (less intrusive than the reset 
patch) on the list. It has been tested by a few people already, and seems to 
improve the situation for some of them. What we would like to know is how 
many people currently suffer from the issue, how bad it gets for them, and 
how the patch will help.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
