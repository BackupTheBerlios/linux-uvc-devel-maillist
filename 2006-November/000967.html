<PRE>Hey George,

&gt;<i> I am also a victim of this issue... FWIW i found the patch worked fine
</I>&gt;<i> last time I tried it (i have since updated from SVN, and as I run
</I>&gt;<i> motion which just opens the camera and keeps it open, the bug doesnt
</I>&gt;<i> hit me that often, so I havent bothered to reapply. However, if my nfs
</I>&gt;<i> drive goes down, motion crashes, and it needs to be re-opened, and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes I therefore have the problem, hence my interest.).
</I>
Just to make sure I understand you right: For you, the bug appeared both  
during opening and capturing but the retry patch fixed the capturing  
problem?

&gt;<i> My question is - even though this is a (nescesary) ugly workaround,
</I>&gt;<i> will it ever be merged into the 'offical' driver?
</I>
Absolutely. We still want to find the nicest possible workaround, but  
_something_ will be integrated in the official driver.

&gt;<i> im guessing the 'offical' windows driver must have something similar
</I>&gt;<i> in it to overcome the hardware bug...
</I>&gt;<i> has anyone tried sniffing a windows session on the USB to see if does
</I>&gt;<i> anything like these resets?
</I>
That's the thing. On Windows, the hardware bug simply isn't triggered. The  
timing of the USB packets is slightly different on Linux and Windows and  
apparently that's enough to trigger the problem.

Cheers,
Martin
