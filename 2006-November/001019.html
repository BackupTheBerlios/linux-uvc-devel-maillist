<PRE>Hi George,

&gt;<i> I think my logitech orbit has died. It was working fine, then the
</I>&gt;<i> machine into which is was plugged reset itself, now the camera gives
</I>&gt;<i> this in dmesg
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> usb 1-3: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 2
</I>&gt;<i> usb 1-3: device descriptor read/64, error -110
</I>&gt;<i> usb 1-3: device descriptor read/64, error -110
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Googling says this is likely hardware failure (it is at a remote site,
</I>&gt;<i> so I havent been able to check if it works on WinXP yet).
</I>
This looks like a hardware problem to me. It might either be your webcam or 
your USB controller. You might want to check that before buying a new webcam.

&gt;<i> Assuming it has failed, I want a new camera. Someone mentioned that
</I>&gt;<i> newer logitech cameras dont suffer from the 'reset usb' problem.
</I>
That's not true, at least not yet. Logitech UVC webcams exist in two 
revisions, both of them suffering from the problem. The third revision should 
have the problem fixed.

&gt;<i> Can someone point me at a camera which works perfectly with your
</I>&gt;<i> drivers please? is the fixed model a new model number, or just a
</I>&gt;<i> revision?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Im looking for something that grabs at around 1024x768 resolution or
</I>&gt;<i> higher.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think UVC is the way to go, for fast updates isnt it? or should I be
</I>&gt;<i> looking at cameras that use other APIs?
</I>
UVC is definitely the way to go, but I don't know of any high resolution UVC 
webcam other than the buggy Logitech ones. There might of course be some that 
I'm not aware of.

I've been told that the second revision webcams can have their firmware 
upgraded, but Logitech is not known to make firmware upgrades available to 
end-users. They could of course change their policy :-)

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
