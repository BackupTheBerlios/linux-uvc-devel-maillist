<PRE>Hi Denis,

&gt;<i> I don't want to overstate the problem: by and
</I>&gt;<i> large, the cameras do hit 15 fps quite accurately, it's just that there
</I>&gt;<i> is some jitter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   To back this up with a little data, you can see the capture times for
</I>&gt;<i> a single camera here: <A HREF="http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-times,">http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-times,</A> the
</I>&gt;<i> differences between consecutive frames here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-differences,">http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-differences,</A> and I've generated a
</I>&gt;<i> histogram of those differences here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/interframe-histogram.png">http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/interframe-histogram.png</A> against a
</I>&gt;<i> logarithmic Y axis.  The histogram shows that the vast majority of the
</I>&gt;<i> inter-frame differences are in the 0.06-ish area, but there are a number
</I>&gt;<i> faster and slower than that.
</I>
Thank you for this data! Looks like 1.6% of all frames are lost. I noticed
that the jitter always start with a very long delay, and they seem to be
quite regular. I have attached a histogram over the time between the
jitters, and the jitter seems to occur at multiples of 80 frames. Hard to
say where it comes from, but it might be a buffering problem?

&gt;<i>   Whether or not this jitter is big enough to cause a problem depends on
</I>&gt;<i> how synchronized you need frames from the cameras to be: the jitter I
</I>&gt;<i> show above is quite tolerable for my purposes.
</I>
While I haven't calculated the tolerable amount yet, I think I probably need
to synchronize the image streams after they have been captured.

&gt;<i> I actually had a
</I>&gt;<i> breakthrough last night, when I realized my audio/visual synch wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> caused by the video frames being non-uniform, but rather that the audio
</I>&gt;<i> I recorded from the USB mics isn't correct.  When I matched the video up
</I>&gt;<i> against the audio from a DV video camera filming the same scene,
</I>&gt;<i> everything looked fine (wrt synch).  Yay!
</I>
Good to know. But actually the video frames should be approximately 1.6%
faster than the audio, based on the data you posted. Maybe that amount is
harder to notice, but after two hours, the difference would be 115 seconds?

ciao
  Pablo
