<PRE>&gt;<i> GStreamer is an X-windows program, right? I'll have to look into it
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow.
</I>
Not exactly. :-) GStreamer is a platform independent multimedia library.
Obviously, using it with V4L2 makes it Linux dependent but there's not
necessarily a GUI associated with it. Most programs that use GStreamer
just happen to have one but like I said, gst-launch has no GUI and it
often takes only a few lines of code to do cool things.

&gt;<i> I've used this entire day trying to get ffmpeg to work, my only hurdle  
</I>&gt;<i> being that it currently doesn't care if I use &quot;-t&quot; so I'm unable to  
</I>&gt;<i> specify a period
</I>&gt;<i> for it to record, and thus it's kind of useless for me..If anyone is  
</I>&gt;<i> interested, this is the line which doesn't work as expected (based on  
</I>&gt;<i> Pierres script)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ffmpeg -vd &quot;/dev/video0&quot; -target vcd -t 15 &quot;test.avi&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (should result in 15-second recording,but it keeps on recording and I  
</I>&gt;<i> have to quit it with &quot;q&quot;)
</I>
I don't see anything obviously wrong with this. But then again, different
programs parse the command line very differently. Have you tried &quot;-t15&quot;
without the space? Also, the man page mentiones a second time format:
      `-t duration'
      Set the recording time in seconds. hh:mm:ss[.xxx] syntax is also
supported.
Might be worth a shot ...

Cheers,
Martin
