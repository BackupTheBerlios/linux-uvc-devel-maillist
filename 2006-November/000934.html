</I>

  The timestamp is just gettimeofday() called from the program doing the
capture, so it's an accurate upper bound on the frame capture time (ie. the
frame can't have been captured any later than the time stamp).although it's
unclear when in the preceding interval the picture actually came from.  I
don't want to overstate the problem: by and large, the cameras do hit 15 fps
quite accurately, it's just that there is some jitter.

  To back this up with a little data, you can see the capture times for a
single camera here: <A HREF="http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-times,">http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-times,</A> the
differences between consecutive frames here:
<A HREF="http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-differences,">http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/capture-differences,</A> and I've generated a
histogram of those differences here:
<A HREF="http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/interframe-histogram.png">http://denism.homeip.net/stuff/interframe-histogram.png</A> against a
logarithmic Y axis.  The histogram shows that the vast majority of the
inter-frame differences are in the 0.06-ish area, but there are a number
faster and slower than that.

  Whether or not this jitter is big enough to cause a problem depends on how
synchronized you need frames from the cameras to be: the jitter I show above
is quite tolerable for my purposes.


&gt;<i>  - Likely as a consequence of the time jitter in the USB bus (or maybe a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem with the cams?  or maybe my capture program?), I'm having a lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of trouble trying to synchronize the video streams from the fusions with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the audio I recorded.  I'm still working on a solution to this one... :(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the timestamp itself is a reliable measure for the jitter, it might be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to leave out or duplicate some frames in post processing.
</I>

  Yeah, I have a script that massages the frames, selecting the right ones
and duping to fill in gaps as needed.  I actually had a breakthrough last
night, when I realized my audio/visual synch wasn't caused by the video
frames being non-uniform, but rather that the audio I recorded from the USB
mics isn't correct.  When I matched the video up against the audio from a DV
video camera filming the same scene, everything looked fine (wrt synch).
Yay!  So my audio-visual synch problem was actually caused by a problem with
my USB audio recording (though there is still some variability in frame
capture times, as shown above).
