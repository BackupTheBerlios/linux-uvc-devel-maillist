<PRE>Hi Laurent,

thanks for the answer!

Ah, ok. great. Problem seems to be gone :)

&gt;<i> &gt; Now my other problem: When reading r187 I hoped to be able to manually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set the white balance, but it doesn't seem to be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Setting V4L2_CID_AUTO_WHITE_BALANCE to 0 doesn't seem to have an effect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The control seems to be neither V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_BOOLEAN nor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_INTEGER, so what else it is?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The control is boolean, and is supposed to work. Do you get an error when
</I>&gt;<i> you try to modify it ? Is anything printed to the kernel log ? Do you get
</I>&gt;<i> the previously written value when you read the control back ?
</I>
Hehe, indeed, it is boolean. I had a typo in my code.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When trying to get V4L2_CID_RED_BALANCE or V4L2_CID_BLUE_BALANCE I get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the error code 22, Invalid argument. In the syslog I find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | uvcvideo: Control 0x0098090e not found.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; | uvcvideo: Control 0x0098090f not found.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this expected to work, or can't this work? It is quite important for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me, to get the manual white balance running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The SPC1300NC has a white balance temperature control, you should use
</I>&gt;<i> V4L2_CID_WHITE_BALANCE_TEMPERATURE instead of V4L2_CID_RED_BALANCE and
</I>&gt;<i> V4L2_CID_BLUE_BALANCE.
</I>
Hm, ok.
Setting V4L2_CID_WHITE_BALANCE_TEMPERATURE seems to work, but the image has a 
red cast. The closer the value is to 2800 (6500 seems to be the default), the 
better the image looks, but even at 2800 Kelvin the red cast is not gone. In 
my use case a red cast is the worst case (blue would be much better)...
I think I once tried the camera with Windows and I could adjust the red and 
blue temperature -- any idea how this is possible? Maybe Philips implemented 
this part somewhere in their driver/user space tool?
What is even worse: The white balance doesn't seem to be fixed if 
V4L2_CID_AUTO_WHITE_BALANCE  is set. The camera still changes the colour 
temperature, when the lighting conditions change. Weird, isn't it? If you 
want I can make a little video to show the effect.

&gt;<i> &gt; Any help is welcome :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helped :-)
</I>
Definitely :-)

Greetings,
Armin
