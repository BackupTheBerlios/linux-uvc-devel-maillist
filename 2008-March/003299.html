<PRE>Hi Moritz,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I forsee flexible functionality as you can find e.g. in the pwc webcam

</I>
This should be done using udev rules. You can then assign a device node to a 
camera based on various parameters such as the device serial number, its 
VID/PID or the module name. This is much more flexible than forcing a 
specific minor with a module parameter.

&gt;<i> Furthermore, while quick-hacking this code, I noticed that linux-uvc
</I>&gt;<i> a) doesn't report its version -&gt; use macro MODULE_VERSION()
</I>&gt;<i> b) doesn't provide parameter descriptions (which can be queried with
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;modinfo uvcvideo&quot;) -&gt; use macro MODULE_PARM_DESC()
</I>
I've committed a fix for a) and b). Thanks for reporting them.

&gt;<i> c) doesn't report which device node it actually assigns to the device,
</I>&gt;<i>    which is very useful in dmesg (and which other drivers tend to do).
</I>
The device minor can be useful, but the message in your patch can be 
misleading as well. The video0 device node doesn't have to be 
called /dev/video0. Some distributions name the device node /dev/v4l/video0. 
The allocated device minor can easily be found using sysfs and I'm a bit 
scared an incorrect /dev/videoX reference in the kernel log messages might 
confuse users.

&gt;<i> So please consider the attached patch two seperate suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i> - general messaging and API documentation improvements
</I>&gt;<i> - a stub for requesting a particular device node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know if you consider it useful, or have something better
</I>&gt;<i> to suggest.
</I>
As stated above, I think device node naming should be handled by udev.

&gt;<i> Thanks for listening, and thanks for the ever so valuable driver!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Patch is against SVN r195.
</I>&gt;<i> I've tested with Logitech QuickCam Fusion on two machines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Moritz
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [*] called device hints in pwc-if.c

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
