<PRE>  I'm sorry about being so stubborn, but I think there must a be a problem
with this somewhere. I hope you don't mind I keep filing information
related to this thread.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Thanks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Since the camera is integrated in the laptop, I doubt it could be a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   I hope this could shed some light into the issue, but meanwhile I'll try

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  Now I got to reproduce the problem. I think it's related to environmental
light somehow. I had some trouble to reproduce problem in the mornings
because I had a lot of natural light, but it was at evening that I was
trying to use the camera. So to test it out I turned on a lighter lamp.
This way it was harder to get the problem, and I only got it when I covered
the camera focus totally, after that, just a black image like the one I
used to see remained there. The only difference was a small whitish point.

  After this I think there's some problem in the light/bright regulation
mechanish. I think next step is starting to look at the code and see where
some of this regulation happen, any pointer would be appreciated.

  Meanwhile I'm attaching the last part of the dmesg output where I released
the camera as soon as I noticed the black frames. I think that may not be
very useful, but just in case...
