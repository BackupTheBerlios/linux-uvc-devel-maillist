<PRE>Hi Laurent,

I wasn't aware that udev could do that. I'll dive into its docs (have
to search first ;-&gt;). This totally obsoletes my method (albeit only for
udev based systems, but are any systems without udev supported
nowadays?).

&gt;<i> The device minor can be useful, but the message in your patch can be 
</I>&gt;<i> misleading as well. The video0 device node doesn't have to be 
</I>&gt;<i> called /dev/video0. Some distributions name the device node /dev/v4l/video0. 
</I>&gt;<i> The allocated device minor can easily be found using sysfs and I'm a bit

</I>
Again, I wasn't aware. Correct, I only see minor. So, first
observation, other kernel modules are reporting incorrectly. ;)
Am I right in assuming that only the higher layers (or even udev)
actually know the proper name of the assigned device node? To me, it's
still a reporting problem. &quot;Oops, where has my TV card landed?
/dev/v4l/video1? Ah, there it is!&quot; (Unfortunately, very few apps
actually detect available V4L devices.)

So currently, I think at least the minor number should be reported. But
I'll have another think about it.

Merci beaucoup,
Moritz
