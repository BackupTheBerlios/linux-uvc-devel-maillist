<PRE>Hi Moritz,

&gt;<i> Hi Laurent, UVCers,

</I>&gt;<i> the quirks parameter was recently introduced to the linux-uvc module,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I was and am fighting with the &#167;%&amp;#! behavior of the SPCA525 ASIC
</I>&gt;<i> in my Logitech QuickCam Fusion 046d:08c1, I luckily came across the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reset&quot; patches, kindly linked from the QC Team site[*]. And the
</I>&gt;<i> patches seem to have helped me, but I'll follow up with more info once
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure whether it works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand why you don't want to make the hacked fixes default in the
</I>&gt;<i> code (it has been stressed many times on the list), but while Logitech
</I>&gt;<i> try to come up with a solution, perhaps a quirks based integration
</I>&gt;<i> would allow many users not to have to patch the driver. The code would
</I>&gt;<i> only become active if explicitly selected with a module parameter. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe that this is what the quirks parameter is perfectly made for,
</I>&gt;<i> and I consider it non-intrusive for the unknowing user.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have ported the two relevant patches:
</I>&gt;<i> a) the reset patch as found in
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="../2007-March/001476.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2007-March/001476.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b) the reset + resubmit urb patch, probably by Evgeny, found in
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2008-January/002830.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2008-January/002830.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> which adds a second mechanism to the first patch.
</I>
Resubmitting URBs should hopefully not be necessary anymore (and it didn't 
work most of the time anyway). Alan Stern wrote a patch for the EHCI 
scheduler that I posted to the list a bit earlier. Please test it if you run 
into -EN2LSYNC (-45) issues.

&gt;<i> Instead of making the code changes &quot;absolute&quot;/&quot;final&quot; or #ifdef'd, I
</I>&gt;<i> made the sections depend on a corresponding quirks mask setting. (Note:
</I>&gt;<i> these are new quirks only defined by module parameter, not the kind
</I>&gt;<i> defined by default by the device model.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The patch is attached. It introduces two new quirks UVC_QUIRK_RESET
</I>&gt;<i> (0x20, I would write it (1&lt;&lt;5)), and UVC_QUIRK_RESUBMIT_URB (0x40,
</I>&gt;<i> better (1&lt;&lt;6)). The functionality is separated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The parameter quirks=32 has consistantly helped the initialization of
</I>&gt;<i> my Logitech QuickCam (incl. safe behavior through plug/unplug,
</I>&gt;<i> load/unload, start/stop of apps) on both my machines, and quirks=96 has
</I>&gt;<i> helped on my laptop through consistent failures (to be confirmed). I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure the reset urb section is needed on my desktop, I think that
</I>&gt;<i> machine has always behaved fine once the UVC device could init itself.
</I>&gt;<i> But activating the reset urb code via the quirk has not hurt either, as
</I>&gt;<i> far as I can tell. Sorry, I don't want to sound like I want this code
</I>&gt;<i> as default behavior - the opposite is the case! :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your opinion is welcomed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Patch is against SVN r195.
</I>&gt;<i> I've tested with Logitech QuickCam Fusion on two machines, both USB 1.1
</I>&gt;<i> and USB 2.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> and many thanks, especially to Laurent, Evgeny, and Michel,
</I>&gt;<i> Moritz

Harold Wheaton posted a patch similar to yours to the mailing list on March 
the 19th. Search the archives for a thread named &quot;UVC patch update and 
results&quot;.

Could you please have a look at Harold's patch and at his latest message in 
the thread ? He proposed a simpler approach that seems to work for him. Could 
you test it on your systems ?

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
