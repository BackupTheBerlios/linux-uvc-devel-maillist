<PRE>  Hello All:

  Once I have a webcam and also a driver that makes it useful, I
thought: &quot;Why not doing videconferencing?&quot; :)

  And that's what I did. I've used skype and kopete using MSN protocol. I
started with kopete, and I had sort of the same problem. At first I blamed
kopete, but since the video conference was not very reliable there I moved
to skype.

  On skype I had the same problem and is this: I can start my video and the
other end will see it, but after a randon time ranging from little seconds
to little minutes, the image I sent (and that I'm able to see) goes to
black unconditionally.

  I'm using 2.6.24.3 with the latest svn driver. This is the skype output:

Skype V4L2: Failed to change capture framerate (15)
Skype V4L2: Failed to change capture framerate (15)
Starting the process...
Skype Xv: Xv ports available: 16
Skype XShm: XShm support enabled
Skype Xv: Using Xv port 75

  This looks like an initialization sequence, after which the video is
working, so I can't get any conclusion from it. It's only after that
undetermined time where it stops working.

  In this case I loaded the uvcvideo module with trace parameter set to 1 so
I expect some debugging info from the driver. This is what I got from
dmesg:

uvcvideo: Probing generic UVC device 3
uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device Chicony USB 2.0 Camera (04f2:b008)
uvcvideo: Scanning UVC chain: OT 2 &lt;- XU 4 &lt;- PU 3 &lt;- IT 1
uvcvideo: Found a valid video chain (1 -&gt; 2).
uvcvideo: UVC device initialized.
usbcore: registered new interface driver uvcvideo
USB Video Class driver (v0.1.0)
compat_ioctl32: v4l2 ioctl VIDIOC_S_PARM, dir=rw (0xc0cc5616)
compat_ioctl32: v4l2 ioctl VIDIOC_S_PARM, dir=rw (0xc0cc5616)

  After this, same as before the video was working at this point, but stops
working after some time. Along the video conference skype seems to try to
reinitialize webcam, it starts working again, but then it goes to black
again.

  I'm willing to provide any information you need, perform any test or try
any patch. Any pointer would be appreciated.

  Thanks for the hard work!

  Regards,
