</I>  No, that's ok. We are all quite busy, specially if you are doing some
important development like it is this driver.

&gt;&gt;<i>   Now I'm more certain that this is a trouble in the light regulation

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> last)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The driver doesn't perform any image processing. What you call light
</I>&gt;<i> regulation is mostly auto-exposure (and maybe to a lesser extent auto
</I>&gt;<i> white balance). Your camera doesn't report any exposure-related control in
</I>&gt;<i> its USB descriptors, so it's not clear if the camera doesn't do any
</I>&gt;<i> exposure control or if it doesn't allow exposure parameters to be changed.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd vote for the second option.
</I>
  I can't be sure about this as well, even more when I haven't tried with
another drivers (BillyOS). But I think it would be odd that having the
possibility of running into this trouble the camera doesn't provide this
controls.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Userspace applications can also implement all kind of image enhancement
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms. That's up to the application, and there's no easy way to know
</I>&gt;<i> what skype does due to its closed-source nature.
</I>
  Well, skype is one case more. As I mentioned the problem also raised with
kopete.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   My most reliable method to reproduce up to know is being on a very soft
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> light environment, for example: night with a dim indirect light(12W low
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consumption lamp). In this situation you will see the image, but not very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well defined using a regular videoconferencing resolution and frame rate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now cover the camera focus completely using your hand, the image will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become totally black and, if the light is not clear enough it will remain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in that state unless you reinitialise the video streaming or use a light
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough light so the brightness regulates automatically to a useful value.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That seems to be a bug either in the camera hardware/firmware or in the
</I>&gt;<i> application. I'd try using the camera with luvcview. If you can reproduce
</I>&gt;<i> the problem the hardware will be to blame. Otherwise skype will be at
</I>&gt;<i> fault.
</I>
  Now that I know how to reproduce the problem and provided your information
I've tried with luvcview and well, I got to reproduce it as well. So this
could be a better starting or (maybe unhopefully) ending point.

  In summary turn on the video streaming where there's very little light, in
the end the camera stream will turn black.

  Thanks a lot for your comments,
