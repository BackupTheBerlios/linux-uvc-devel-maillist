<PRE>  Hello:

  Basically same story but with some more appreciations.

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  Now I'm more certain that this is a trouble in the light regulation
mechanism, but I don't know how to get more information from the driver. I
don't know even where the light regulation happens. Is it on driver, on
hardware or in the userspace application by chance (doubtfully this last)?

  My most reliable method to reproduce up to know is being on a very soft
light environment, for example: night with a dim indirect light(12W low
consumption lamp). In this situation you will see the image, but not very
well defined using a regular videoconferencing resolution and frame rate.
Now cover the camera focus completely using your hand, the image will
become totally black and, if the light is not clear enough it will remain
in that state unless you reinitialise the video streaming or use a light
enough light so the brightness regulates automatically to a useful value.

  Thanks for your patience, and I still appreciate help and/or pointers.

  Regards,
