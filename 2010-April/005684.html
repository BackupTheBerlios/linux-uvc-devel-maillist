<PRE>Hi Ian, list,

So just the usual marketing bulls**t, as we had expected. ;-) Can't
Americans sue these kinds of marketers?

Excellent, I think this is one of the analyses I have been waiting for
for a long time.

Depending on how you calculate that, several Logitech devices might be
able to compete. At least the resolutions are okay, but I think they
don't actually hit the 30 fps mark at max resolution, though they do at
720p:

Note: I don't advocate Logitech, indeed they have built quite some
junk. Furthermore, I believe that other manufacturers may also hit the
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/linux-uvc-devel">30fps at 720p</A> mark.

What's really missing are more reviews and experience reports such as
this:
&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://the-gadgeteer.com/2010/03/26/tandberg-precisionhd-usb-video-camera-review/">http://the-gadgeteer.com/2010/03/26/tandberg-precisionhd-usb-video-camera-review/</A>
</I>
And comparisons for quality: lens/sharpness, noise, stability of FPS,
overall stability, and of course linux-uvc compatibility. :-)

&gt;<i> via USB;  <A HREF="http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK">http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK</A>

Thanks for this very interesting link!
(We have a spare IXUS at home, after my wife upgraded to the excellent
PowerShot SX200 IS. That IXUS should work with CHDK. Could they also
please support Panasonic? :-))

I am still looking for a way to use a digital camera as a remote
control single-shot or video camera - similar to a webcam but with a
better much better sensor and lense, but perhaps less FPS due to
single-shot mode. The gphoto suite does support this for some models,
but I have never owned one which happened to have this gphoto support.

Thanks,
Moritz
