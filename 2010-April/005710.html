Do the number of URBs have any effect at all?  I made an initial attempt 
to check this a while back by recompiling the driver with UVC_URBS as 1 
or 2 instead of 5.  Changed the MAX_ISO_PACKETS a lot smaller too.  I 
wanted to see if perhaps submitting less URBs would somehow lessen the 
bandwidth requirements.  It didn't fix the problem though.

I suspect that somewhere in an underlying layer, whether kernel or 
physical, something is checking that bandwidth requirement for the 
configured endpoints and then denying new URBs being submitted.  I'm not 
opposed to modifying something at a lower level but I haven't found the 
spot at this point.  I guess if the error comes from the physical hub 
there isn't much to be done then.

</I>&gt;<i> Also the device will always try to dispatch frames at the requested
</I>&gt;<i> framerate, if you don't grab them they will simply be dropped by the
</I>&gt;<i> driver.
</I>
I wonder if there is some way to restrict URB submitting to around 10 
fps?  Perhaps a semaphore on the number of cameras that can be 
submitting URBs at all.  If I go ahead and configure all the cameras to 
run at 15 fps but only submit URBs for say 3 of the cameras at a time it 
seems it would work.  I'm not worried about dropping 1/3 of the frames. 
  I don't think I can write them all out to storage fast enough anyway. 
  (I can come close to keeping up with 10 fps on 8 cameras though.)
