One idea I've been toying with is to add a semaphore around submitting 
the URBs.

In uvc_video.c, where the URBs are submitted, I'd acquire a semephore 
for each device currently submitting URBs.  The semaphore would limit 
the number of devices to whatever number I decide can safely submit URBs 
simultaneously on the bus without throwing out of space errors.

I did an initial test of this and it looks promising.  I can configure 
all the cameras.  As long as I don't submit the URBs for the number of 
devices beyond that which will work at the same time, the other cameras 
simply drop the data.

I'm not sure the best places to control the locking and unlocking of the 
semaphore are.  Right now, I lock it before submitting URBs in 
uvc_init_video.  In uvc_video_complete, I unlock it and relock it if the 
buffer is complete (allowing another camera to acquire it and capture a 
frame).

Anyway, it isn't working perfectly yet but I think I can debug it and at 
least get to a point where I know if it's worth pursuing.  I'm curious 
if anyone can provide thoughts or alternatives.

Thanks
Dennis
