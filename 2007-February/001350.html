<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have any ideas on this one ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I sometimes get jumbled images if my cable is too long...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Really - do you get the same type of &quot;jumbling&quot; as in the example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; images I posted ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My cameras are both Logitec Quickcam 5000s, and each have a 2m USB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extension - but which probably takes them up to around 3-4m in total.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will have a go at temporarily moving the box closer to the cams and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see if the problem goes away without the extensions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lee

</I>&gt;<i> I get discoloured lower half frames, images from past frames, and a few
</I>&gt;<i> other things.  Heck though, it won't hurt to give it a go with shorter
</I>&gt;<i> cables... although I did manage to get to 10M by using a hub with one cam!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well what do you know.

I recabled my cams last night and made 2 changes:
1) Attached them to the USB ports at the rear of my PC, which connect
direct to the motherboard, and
2) Noticed one of the USB extension cables had a lump of gunk in it's
socket, preventing full mating to the connector on the cam cable (only
by a tiny amount, perhaps 1-2mm - but it was on the cam producing
jumbled images).

The jumbled image problem seems to have gone away.

So it was either the incomplete mating of the extension cable, or the
fact I was using the front panel USB connectors on my PC - instead of
connecting directly to the motherboard they are connected to it by a
foot or so of loose fly leads, these are not twisted or shielded.
Maybe these were allowing noise, and using the direct motherboard
connection prevents this.

Anyway, whichever it was - problem solved.
Many thanks for your suggestion Brad.
