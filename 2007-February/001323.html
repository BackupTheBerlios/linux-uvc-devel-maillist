yes i know - probably not a smart decision given that they define an API,
so the impact is not just on the kernel but also third party
code written for userland.

I find it also somewhat ironical that someone writing GPL code (where
the license claims &quot;... the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software&quot;) may
also assert that their code is not designed to be portable, because
this negates the share/reuse principle in the first place.

On the other hand, i understand that changing things now would
be problematic. In my version of videodev2.h i do this:

	/*
	 * This file has some anonymous unions that are invalid for C99,
	 * but required by some linux apps that use this interface.
	 * As a workaround, we put a default name of 'u' to them,
	 * unless the caller compiles with -DANONYMOUS_UNION
	 * and then we set to the empty string.
	 */
	#ifndef ANONYMOUS_UNION
	#define ANONYMOUS_UNION u
	#else
	#undef  ANONYMOUS_UNION /* clear previous value */
	#define ANONYMOUS_UNION /* and set to empty */
	#endif

	...

		union {                                 /* Frame size */
			struct v4l2_frmsize_discrete    discrete;
			struct v4l2_frmsize_stepwise    stepwise;
		} ANONYMOUS_UNION;
	...

so at compile time you can adapt to both dialect.

&gt;<i> of gcc I think you'd have a hard time finding a platform to port V4L2 to  
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't support these constructs.
</I>
right - but sometimes you need to build software from various sources
and it is a pain to use different compiler settings for each source file.

i suspect it would turn into a religion war.

For the time being i just wanted to raise the portability issues to
this project, and would just be happy if you would take the
the pros and cons in proper consideration.

thanks for the feeback
