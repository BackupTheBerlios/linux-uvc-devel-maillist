You're probably referring to:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2006-October/000841.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2006-October/000841.html</A>

I've no idea what happened there, but feel free to ask the guy before you  
start coding yourself.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, considering the v4l2 API does not really have an interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for single image still frame capture, I'm wondering if anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has any thoughts on how best to handle that.  My application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requires capturing a single frame at a very specific time (not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a regular interval).  I am totally fine with bypassing the v4l
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> layer and interfacing with the driver directly if need be, but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would like to do something with general utility to the most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users, not just a hack that only I can use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> V4L2 can start and stop video streaming at any time. All you have to do  
</I>&gt;<i> is initialise the device (allocate buffers, set the video format, ...),  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> start streaming when you need an image. You can stop streaming right  
</I>&gt;<i> after getting the data, and start again later when required by your  
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>
Laurent, I think Thad was talking about actual still image support (UVC  
standard, section 2.4.2.4), which can - if the camera supports it -  
provide better quality than the streaming modes.

It would be great if you could actually implement that. We've had  
discussions about how best to do it before and didn't actually reach a  
conclusion. My personal favorite is this: dd if=/dev/video0  
of=mystillpicture.jpg

If that's in the spirit of V4L2 or not is probably subject to discussion  
and there are several other ways to do it, so if you want to have a go,  
we'll be happy to help.

&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps I should join the v4l dev mailing list and see what their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoughts are.  Your input is appreciated.
</I>
 From my experience the V4L mailing list is most helpful when you already  
have a more or less concrete suggestion and want people's opinions. Can't  
hurt after you've given it some thought.

Cheers,
Martin
