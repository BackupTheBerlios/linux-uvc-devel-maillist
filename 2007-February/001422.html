I've traded some email with the guy.  Unfortunately he needed to
getting something working quickly and decided to go with a different
solution.

&gt;<i> &gt; start streaming when you need an image. You can stop streaming right

</I>&gt;<i> Laurent, I think Thad was talking about actual still image support (UVC
</I>&gt;<i> standard, section 2.4.2.4), which can - if the camera supports it -

</I>
Yes, this is exactly right.  The QC notebook pro can capture a still
image at 1.3 megapixel, much better than any single frame when it
is streaming.  This is one of the few webcams that can produce stills
of that quality that and is definitely the smallest I've found.  That is
important for my application; I plan to suspend it on a flexible arm
over my drafting table to use it as part of my animation toolchain.

&gt;<i> It would be great if you could actually implement that. We've had
</I>&gt;<i> discussions about how best to do it before and didn't actually reach a
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion. My personal favorite is this: dd if=/dev/video0
</I>&gt;<i> of=mystillpicture.jpg
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If that's in the spirit of V4L2 or not is probably subject to discussion

</I>
I'll probably dive in and try to get the communication to the camera
correct first.  The interface can always be adjusted later.  I'm off to
a good start... I've got the current linux-uvc driver working with the
webcam, I've downloaded the UVC standards docs, and I've logged
an initial capture of traffic on the USB bus while taking some snaps
with the webcam on a WinXP system.  I'll probably dig through the
UVC docs and the capture file over the next few days in my spare
time.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Perhaps I should join the v4l dev mailing list and see what their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; thoughts are.  Your input is appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  From my experience the V4L mailing list is most helpful when you already
</I>&gt;<i> have a more or less concrete suggestion and want people's opinions. Can't
</I>&gt;<i> hurt after you've given it some thought.
</I>
Well, I'll at least lurk on the v4l list for while.

Later,

Thad Phetteplace
