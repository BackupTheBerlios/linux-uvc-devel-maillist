&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> sorry for reheating my question, but I'm still in search of the 
</I>&gt;<i> component to blame, that the cam is not working. I understand that the 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux distro I'm using is in alpha state so problems have to be expected.

Hi,

I've bought this Webcam yesterday, too, in trust of <A HREF="http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/#devices.">http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/#devices.</A>

I want to add the output of v4l-video here, hoping it helps somehow ;-)

I've modified the usb_driver.c of uvc, like mentioned in another posting:

static struct usb_device_id uvc_ids[] = {
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; { .match_flags = USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_DEVICE
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; | USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_INT_INFO,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .idVendor = 0x046d,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .idProduct = 0x08ce,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .bInterfaceClass = USB_CLASS_VENDOR_SPEC,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .bInterfaceSubClass = 1,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .bInterfaceProtocol = 0
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; },
[..]

This is the output of v4l-info:
