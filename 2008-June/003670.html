Thanks for the information.

How long is a long sleep ?

The UVC driver uses five mutexes:

- to guard against the open()/disconnect() race
- to serialize access to the global controls list
- to serialize access to device controls
- to serialize streaming format negotiation
- to serialize access to the video buffers queue

Access to device controls shouldn't take more than 10ms, unless the device is 
buggy in which case the URB will timeout after 300ms. Likewise, streaming 
format negotiation shouldn't sleep for more than a few dozens of 
milliseconds.

The video buffers queue mutex is taken when performing the following 
operations:

- buffer allocation/deallocation
- buffer query (VIDIOC_QUERYBUF)
- buffer enqueuing and dequeuing (VIDIO_QBUF and VIDIOC_DQBUF)
- buffer queue activation and deactivation (VIDIOC_STREAMON and
  VIDIOC_STREAMOFF, release(), system resume)
- poll()
- mmap()
- release()

Buffer dequeuing can sleep for a longer time than most other operations, as it 
waits for a video buffer to be ready. However, no other operation from the 
above list should be performed while a VIDIOC_DQBUF is in progress.

Does this make sense, or is there a place where I should try to drop a lock 
before sleeping ?

</I>
Getting locking right is very difficult. I spent a lot of time checking corner 
cases when developing the driver, and I'm pretty sure a few race conditions 
still exist, especially when then ioctl code will not be covered by the BKL 
anymore. I would greatly appreciate anyone reviewing the patch I will post 
soon to get the UVC driver included in the mainline kernel for race 
conditions and locking issues.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
