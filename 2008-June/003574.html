It appears there is <A HREF="http://www.linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/">http://www.linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/</A> 
V4L2UserspaceLibrary project that would do MJPEG-&gt;YUV conversion in  
userspace if any, I do admit that doing it in the driver would be  
stupid. However it looks like there is also the gstfakevideo that can  
do the conversion using gstreamer since V4L2 solution is not quite  
ready yet. However in the case of SiGma Micro it fails as well.

I just realized after reading mailing lists that before that patch it  
wasn't on the supported list at all. And I am not sure if it should  
be there quite yet. As mentioned the camera works with luvcview, but  
that is the only application it works with. I can't use gstfakevideo,  
because gstreamer gives the error message Lorenzo Battistini already  
mentioned:

Failed querying control 9963788 on device '/dev/video0'. (5 - Input/ 
output error)

Ekiga, mplayer, etc. all fail as well. On both Windows and Mac OS X  
the camera works like a charm. If anyone has any ideas where the  
problem is, I would be happy to hear them. Meanwhile I will try to  
research myself and will keep posting possible updates here. Getting  
the gstfakevideo would already be enough, because I believe it will  
fix all the applications with its YUV conversion...
