<PRE>Hi,

I revently bought a SiGma Micro camera and am pretty happy with it,
since as it's UVC compliant it works out-of-the-box on windows and mac.
On Linux it does work with uvcvideo, but the only application I have
been able to make it work is luvcview, which means that the camera
itself doesn't have a problem. However I haven't been able to get it to
work with any other application, which is a pity.

Now if I check the luvcview -L it shows the following:

luvcview version 0.2.1 
Video driver: x11
A window manager is available
video /dev/video0 
/dev/video0 does not support read i/o
{ pixelformat = 'MJPG', description = 'MJPEG' }
{ discrete: width = 320, height = 240 }
	Time interval between frame: {min { 1/30 } .. max { 1/15 } / stepsize
{ 1/30 } }, 
{ discrete: width = 640, height = 480 }
	Time interval between frame: {min { 1/30 } .. max { 1/15 } / stepsize
{ 1/30 } }, 
{ discrete: width = 160, height = 120 }
	Time interval between frame: {min { 1/30 } .. max { 1/15 } / stepsize
{ 1/30 } }, 


It looks like my camera only supports MJPEG modes and this is supported
by the fact that if I start to run luvcview in yuv mode, it fails to
run:

luvcview version 0.2.1 
Video driver: x11
A window manager is available
video /dev/video0 
Unable to set format: 22.
 Init v4L2 failed !! exit fatal 

Now my question is, if uvcvideo driver would do some MJPEG-&gt;YUV
conversion, would it be possible to make my camera work in other or at
least applications? I could try to experiment with this stuff myself too
if someone would point me to the correct direction.

I also assume that SiGma Micro is even actively developed since r211
patch is SiGma specific and r212 frameintervals fix also fixed the thing
on SiGma, thanks for that. :) If there's anything I can do, let me know.


Regards,

Juho V&#228;h&#228;-Herttua
