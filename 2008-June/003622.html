<PRE>So, I got this new webcam today - it is a Philips SPC 1300NC (0471:0331). Unlike other webcam's I've had (I had a logitech QC pro 5000, which worked marvelously with the UVC driver, but it caught fire unfortunately - it would have a slow shutter speed and blur, but the framerate was always 30 when I asked it to be), instead of sending a constant frame rate, no matter the lighting conditions, this camera seems to sync the framerate with the shutter speed - in less-than-daylight conditions, it sends 5 frames per second out, after telling what ever program (luvcview, mplayer, gst-launch, or a simple python video-grabbing script I wrote, available here: <A HREF="http://www.ndeschildre.net/2008/04/29/python-and-webcam-part-2/">http://www.ndeschildre.net/2008/04/29/python-and-webcam-part-2/</A> ) I try it with to use 30 FPS. luvcview shows FPS at the top, and indeed the camera's output goes from 30FPS if I shove it up to my computer monitor, to 5 FPS if I point it at me. It gives somewhat comical results when I record a video as it
 plays back at 30FPS, so 30 seconds of recording becomes a 6 second clip of me moving very fast. Unfortunately, comical was not why I bought the camera.

I read a post around the 19th of May on this list regarding a similar issue with an SPC 1000NC camera, though I never heard anything further regarding it. Does anyone know if this is a hardware issue that was 'patched' by philips' Windows drivers (90FPS and 6 megapixels my ass!) and I should just return this turd, or is it something that could be fixed with software? The only thing that swayed me from buying another QC5000 was the 1280x1024 capture, but it only goes to 15FPS with this camera, and I have a real camera if I need to take pictures. Let me know if you all need anymore information, or any thoughts on the subject. Thanks,

 -rich
