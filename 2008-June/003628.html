<PRE>Hi Rich,

</I>&gt;<i> Unlike other webcam's I've had (I had a logitech QC pro 5000, which worked
</I>&gt;<i> marvelously with the UVC driver, but it caught fire unfortunately - it

</I>&gt;<i> when I asked it to be), instead of sending a constant frame rate, no matter
</I>&gt;<i> the lighting conditions, this camera seems to sync the framerate with the
</I>&gt;<i> shutter speed - in less-than-daylight conditions, it sends 5 frames per
</I>&gt;<i> second out, after telling what ever program (luvcview, mplayer, gst-launch,
</I>&gt;<i> or a simple python video-grabbing script I wrote, available here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ndeschildre.net/2008/04/29/python-and-webcam-part-2/">http://www.ndeschildre.net/2008/04/29/python-and-webcam-part-2/</A> ) I try it
</I>&gt;<i> with to use 30 FPS. luvcview shows FPS at the top, and indeed the camera's
</I>&gt;<i> output goes from 30FPS if I shove it up to my computer monitor, to 5 FPS if
</I>&gt;<i> I point it at me. It gives somewhat comical results when I record a video
</I>&gt;<i> as it plays back at 30FPS, so 30 seconds of recording becomes a 6 second
</I>&gt;<i> clip of me moving very fast. Unfortunately, comical was not why I bought
</I>&gt;<i> the camera.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I read a post around the 19th of May on this list regarding a similar issue
</I>&gt;<i> with an SPC 1000NC camera, though I never heard anything further regarding
</I>&gt;<i> it. Does anyone know if this is a hardware issue that was 'patched' by
</I>&gt;<i> philips' Windows drivers (90FPS and 6 megapixels my ass!) and I should just
</I>&gt;<i> return this turd, or is it something that could be fixed with software?
</I>
Most webcams have an auto-exposure feature enabled by default that will raise 
the exposure time in low light conditions, making the frame rate drop. 
Auto-exposure can be turned off using the V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_AUTO control on 
models that export the auto-exposure control. The SPC1300NC seems to support 
that.

You will not be able to get more than 30fps though. The UVC descriptors report 
frame rates up to 30fps only, and I think Philips use software interpolation 
to achieve 90fps (even though they could use private commands to switch to 
higher frame rates, but I really doubt that).

&gt;<i> The only thing that swayed me from buying another QC5000 was the 1280x1024
</I>&gt;<i> capture, but it only goes to 15FPS with this camera, and I have a real
</I>&gt;<i> camera if I need to take pictures.
</I>
The QC 5000 is limited to 15fps at 1280x1024 but can probably achieve higher 
frame rates at lower resolutions.

&gt;<i> Let me know if you all need anymore 
</I>&gt;<i> information, or any thoughts on the subject. Thanks,
</I>
Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
