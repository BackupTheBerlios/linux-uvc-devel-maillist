Format conversion doesn't belong in the kernel. Linus Torvald has been quite 
clear on that.

There is currently no universal userspace solution. The gstreamer framework is 
interesting but not as stable as it should be with v4l2 devices. Other 
projects such as the one you mentioned have been started but are usually 
nowhere near completion.

&gt;<i> &gt; I also assume that SiGma Micro is even actively developed since r211
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patch is SiGma specific and r212 frameintervals fix also fixed the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thing on SiGma, thanks for that. :) If there's anything I can do, let me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just realized after reading mailing lists that before that patch it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't on the supported list at all. And I am not sure if it should
</I>&gt;<i> be there quite yet. As mentioned the camera works with luvcview, but
</I>&gt;<i> that is the only application it works with. I can't use gstfakevideo,
</I>&gt;<i> because gstreamer gives the error message Lorenzo Battistini already
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Failed querying control 9963788 on device '/dev/video0'. (5 - Input/
</I>&gt;<i> output error)
</I>
I had a closer look at the USB descriptors. The camera reports a selector unit 
and two input terminals, one for the camera sensor and one for a composite 
input.

Does your webcam really have multiple inputs ?

&gt;<i> Ekiga, mplayer, etc. all fail as well. On both Windows and Mac OS X
</I>&gt;<i> the camera works like a charm. If anyone has any ideas where the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is, I would be happy to hear them. Meanwhile I will try to
</I>&gt;<i> research myself and will keep posting possible updates here. Getting
</I>&gt;<i> the gstfakevideo would already be enough, because I believe it will
</I>&gt;<i> fix all the applications with its YUV conversion...
</I>
Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
