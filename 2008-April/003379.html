</I>&gt;<i> Good to know about the version.h thing, I was afraid that was the
</I>&gt;<i> problem as the 08ce was no in the uvc_driver.c file until I added it.
</I>&gt;<i> We are having problems with some of our Logitech QC 5000's.  When we
</I>&gt;<i> create the module on the same kernel we keep getting things in dmesg
</I>&gt;<i> like the following:
</I>&gt;<i> uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device &lt;unnamed&gt; (046d:08ce)
</I>&gt;<i> uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 2 (unit 0) : -71 (exp. 26).
</I>&gt;<i> uvcvideo: Failed to initialize the device (-5).
</I>
-71 is -EPROTO. This is a low level error that can be caused either by 
electrical issues (noisy environment, bad cables, bad USB ports, ...) or a 
buggy device (firmware and/or hardware).

The Logitech QC 5000 is known to be buggy. Sad but true. There are lots of 
timing issues that are usually not triggered when using the webcam under 
Windows. Linux has different timings, and things sometimes break depending on 
your kernel version, on the USB controller, on the CPU speed, ...

Plugging the camera into another USB port might help. If it doesn't I'm afraid 
there's not much I can do.

&gt;<i> This prevents us from seeing any video and causes ekiga to crash with
</I>&gt;<i> the following error in dmesg logs:
</I>&gt;<i> Apr 15 10:51:39 duel kernel: uvcvideo: Failed to query (132) UVC control
</I>&gt;<i> 4 (unit 2) : -32 (exp. 2).
</I>
That's a non-fatal error that you will see quite often when you run into 
timing issues. It basically means Ekiga tried to modify a control (probably 
brightness in this case) and the device didn't answer the request because of 
timings issues caused by a firmware bug.

&gt;<i> On my other machine  I am getting past the dmesg part with both the QC
</I>&gt;<i> 5000 and 9000, ekiga still doesn't want to switch video with whomever I
</I>&gt;<i> call, but I believe that might be an ekiga problem.  I can still look at
</I>&gt;<i> gstreamer-properties and see video without errors.  I was afraid this
</I>&gt;<i> was just due to vendor ids not being listed, but it looks like I was
</I>&gt;<i> troubleshooting down the wrong path.  Any ideas what could case those
</I>&gt;<i> issues?
</I>
Webcam bugs unfortunately :-( There might be a way to work around them in 
software, but that would require in-depth analysis with a USB 2.0 analyser, 
comparing traces captured using Windows and Linux, ...

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
