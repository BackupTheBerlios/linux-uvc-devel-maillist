</I>
The Linux UVC driver will map UVC controls to standard V4L2 controls when 
possible. As the UVC standard allows vendor-defined controls, the driver will 
sooner or later run into controls that have no corresponding V4L2 control ID. 
For those UVC controls the driver will have to use private V4L2 controls. 
Several vendor-defined UVC controls will be mapped to the same private V4L2 
control when possible.

Those mappings can either be hardcoded in the driver or provided by userspace 
tools. The first solution would be hard to maintain and would require 
frequent changes to the driver. This is why we went for the second solution.

I'm sorry that recent versions of the driver had to break binary 
compatibility. This was unfortunately unavoidable, as V4L2 IDs for many 
controls were temporary and changed when we got them standardised in V4L2. 
This shouldn't happen anymore as those controls are now part of the V4L2 API.

&gt;<i> Hmm, if it really *has* to be a userspace solution, the still-non-existent

</I>
They are not supposed to break at regular intervals :-)

Binary incompatibilities are caused by the driver changing V4L2 control IDs 
combined with an application that hardcodes control IDs. The control mapping 
implementation (kernelspace vs. userspace) is irrelevant.

To avoid breakages applications should avoid hardcoding private controls IDs 
when possible, and the control mapper should avoid changing control IDs for 
no reason. Now that the infrastructure is getting more stable there should be 
less binary compatibility issues.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
