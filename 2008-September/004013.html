</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Way back in April last year, Sam Revitch sent an email to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; linux-uvc-devel[1] announcing the work he had been doing on r5u870,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which provided a working webcam to those users with cameras using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Ricoh chipset. In January this year, I took up the task of maintaining
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the driver (since Sam had seemingly gone MIA). Maintaining an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; out-of-kernel driver and having very little time to tend to it (we now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; support 15 different camera models, up from 3 ;) has become very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; difficult as of late, and bug reports regarding conflicts between the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; r5u870 and uvcvideo modules seem to becoming more and more frequent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; uvcvideo also seems to do a better job at the UVC stuff than the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; driver on most devices, anyway. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I've done a bit of hacking in an effort to retrofit uvcvideo with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; firmware-loading functionality of the original r5u870 driver. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; appears to work reasonably well. However, before I go and work on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; something worth committing, I was just curious as to whether I should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; attempting to implement it in the kernel module (less work for me :) or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; as a userspace application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've discussed firmware loading issues previously with iSight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers, and I wasn't very keen on adding firmware loading support to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the UVC driver, especially with a userspace utility already available (the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; iSight is based on a Cypress chip). How do Ricoh webcams enumerate when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the firmware is not loaded ? Is the firmware loading protocol specific to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ricoh devices ? 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I'm aware, all Ricoh devices use the same firmware loading
</I>&gt;<i> protocol. Looking at the source for the iSight cameras the other day,
</I>&gt;<i> and found that they also interestingly use the same command while
</I>&gt;<i> uploading firmware data (although a different format from what I
</I>&gt;<i> gather).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before the firmware is uploaded to the devices, they still report via
</I>&gt;<i> the USB descriptor that they are webcam devices, hence why uvcvideo
</I>&gt;<i> picks it up.
</I>
Does the device expose different descriptors after a firmware upgrade ? Does 
it simulate a disconnection/reconnection when you upload the firmware ?

Could you please provide me with a full USB descriptors dump ('lsusb -v' with 
usbutils 0.72 or newer) ? If descriptors before and after firmware loading 
differ please send me both. I would also be interested in having a look at 
the firmware file.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; One thing that might be an issue that I'm not sure was ever resolved in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the communication between yourself and Chris was that regarding the UVC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; controls. As you might remember, the microcode that gets uploaded to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; camera doesn't report all the controls it supports. Would it be possible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to use some of the quirk modes provided by uvcvideo to get around that?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you list the Ricoh &quot;features&quot; that are not UVC-compliant ? Are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the non-reported controls addressed with standard UVC requests or with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proprietary protocol ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the most part, the controls that aren't reported but supported are
</I>&gt;<i> all accessible through the standard controls, you just have to know
</I>&gt;<i> which camera supports which.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once the firmware is uploaded, everything is handled by the UVC
</I>&gt;<i> specification.
</I>
Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
