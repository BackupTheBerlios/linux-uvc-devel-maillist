Laurent,

I have just replicated the issue here, and have discovered that while ekiga sometimes gets a completely black picture, luvcview is able to receive a properly exposed picture instead. (Mind you, ekiga also uses a much smaller picture size that luvcview - I think it's only qcif 176x144 pixels.) One time, I was actually able to make out &quot;moving bits&quot; in ekiga's video window which corresponded to where I was sitting, so it's definitely receiving an image.

Cheers,
Chris
