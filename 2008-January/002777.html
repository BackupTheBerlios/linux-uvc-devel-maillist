<PRE>Hi Laurent,

I have tested svn version 166. The results are the following:

- luvcview works after proper detection as almost always.

- Skype turned on camera but failed to get picture when started after luvcview.

- luvcview failed when started again after Skype failed as above.

luvcview stderr: &quot;unable to set format: 5.&quot;
dmesg:
uvcvideo: Failed to query (130) UVC control 3 (unit 2) : -32 (exp. 2).
uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 0) : -32 (exp. 26).
uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 0) : -32 (exp. 26).

uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 0) : -110 (exp. 26).

- after some rmmod/insmod cycles and proper redetection I've started
Skype without starting any other programs in between. It started to
work but the picture was distorted, to be more exact, it was stretched
to about 120% of the original in the Y (vertical) direction from the
center of the image but basically your code change seems to work! :)

I have also tested what luvcview controls work and how:

brightness - works
contrast - works
saturation - works
gain - works
sharpness - setting works but no apparent effect
gamma - adjusted down with effect but then could not be adjusted up anymore
reset to default - works sometimes (only when camera is in a workable state?)
pan - ioctl querycontrol error 22
tilt - ioctl querycontrol error 22
pan/tilt reset - ioctl querycontrol error 22
switch light freq filter - works
exposure - ioctl set control error
auto exposure - setting works but apparently always remains on
white balance - ioctl set control error
auto white balance - setting works but apparently always remains on

&gt;<i> The driver already includes workarounds for various broken devices.
</I>&gt;<i> Have a look at the UVC_QUIRK_* macros in uvcvideo.h and how they are
</I>&gt;<i> associated with devices in uvc_driver.c.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For early Logitech devices, however, no satisfying workaround has
</I>&gt;<i> been find so far.
</I>
I see, what I was suggesting wasn't device specific: it's about not having
to dig up the sources to enable/disable a hack but to be able to control
them on the module parameter level.

I don't have a clue but what I can imagine as a solution for the QC Fusion
in particular is that it should be detected somehow when the camera gets
into an unworkable state (failed uvc control queries or failed initialization)
and then it should be reset or reenumerated. Basically doing automatically
what one is doing by hand using rmmod/insmod cycles when it's apparent
from the dmesg that the camera is probably unworkable...

By the way recently I have seen various cameras working under
Windows and apparently several of them are buggy enough to freeze
or get unworkable within a certain amount of time of submitting
video. Even original OEM Windows drivers seem to reset these cams
repeatedly (at least it seems like it) as a solution which results
in temporary video breakages in a video enabled Skype connection.
So it's not unique to the QC Fusion and Linux I guess...

Thanks!

Best regards,
Sab
