<PRE>Hello!

I'm blessed with a Logitech QC Fusion (046d:08c1) in my neighborhood...
I get (the usual?) problems on enumeration:

As you can see, after several rmmod/modprobe cycles on uvcvideo sooner
or later the camera gets detected. Somewhere I've read that this
problem is restricted to high-speed usb mode so I tried to rmmod ehci-hcd
but apparently it doesn't work any better in full-speed mode than in
high-speed mode.

Anyway, after an occasional correct detection of the camera,
the following behavior can be observed:

- Skype can see /dev/video1 and also provides the USB id
of the camera in the drop down box. After starting camera test,
it takes some seconds for the camera to turn on (it's blue led
comes on) but no picture comes through and CPU usage jumps to
100% permanently while there is no video at all as long as I
do not stop the camera test.

- Camorama simply says it cannot open /dev/video1 and that's it.

- luvcview works seamlessly, as many times I want! Even after the
above applications have failed to open the camera, luvcview always
works even afterwards, both with ehci-hcd enabled and without!

Does luvcview use some hack/fix/kludge that makes it work?
What makes this difference that it works while other apps don't?

Versions:
kernel 2.6.23-gentoo-r5 PREEMPT
linux-uvc-0.1.0_pre157
luvcview-20070512
camorama-0.19
skype-2.0.0.27

Thanks,

Sab
