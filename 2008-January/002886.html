Although not directly related to linux-uvc development, I think this is 
the right crowd to ask this question.

I have a point-and-shoot Fuji camera, with webcam support. It works 
really well with linux-uvc driver thanks to  Laurent's efforts a while 
back. It produces MJPEG only. It doesn't have a YUYV option. That's ok 
for something like egika, but skype seems to not like it. I think it 
only accepts YUV raw streams.

Now my question is this. Is there an application/module that can sit 
between the video device and something like skype, converting the MJPEG 
in run-time to YUYV? Some kind of post-processing module that creates a 
re-directed video device, which can then be used by other applications. 
So you'll probably get something like '/dev/video1' which is in fact the 
processed '/dev/video0' (in my case the decoded MJPEG stream).

I would be really surprised if something like this doesn't exist. It's a 
really cool thing to have in general. A basic search on google didn't 
return anything relevant.

regards
-Ioannis
