<PRE>Hi Pierre,
The output of mjpg-streamer looks good, revision #54 is the most recent 
version.
&gt;<i> The picture in firefox is wrong too.
</I>
Damn...


&gt;<i> Also i have tried the output_file plugin, and set up with the --folder 
</I>&gt;<i> thing after looking at the sources to know the parametters to use. But 
</I>&gt;<i> this output plugin gives a segmentation fault.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Damn again...

&gt;<i> Also a fast question:
</I>&gt;<i> in the sources, i see a resolution table which only goes to 1280 x 
</I>&gt;<i> 1024 (Which is SUFFICENT for me, no problem). Does it mean that the 
</I>&gt;<i> 1600 x 1200 is software-side interpolated? What if i add UXGA 1600 
</I>&gt;<i> 1200 in the table? :)
</I>
No, the table is only used if you want to use a named resolution like 
SXGA or VGA. If you pass a certain resolution like 1600x1200 is will 
parse the values and tell the driver about the desired resolution. Have 
you tried other, smaller resolutions too? Perhaps i have an issue with 
those high resolutions.

&gt;<i> For now, i would be more than happy if the HTTP output plugin can give 
</I>&gt;<i> me &quot;real&quot; colors. Any clue for this please?
</I>
If i would know better i would already have a fixed code. So i am afraid 
we have to go bug hunting. Considered your tight schedule you may want 
to try something other and come back to this issues later?

&gt;<i> Thanks a lot for your support, for now you're the only person who 
</I>&gt;<i> provided me with a fast solution... So i place my hope in your 
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge now :D
</I>
I will do my very best, but it is difficult because in my setup it works 
(Ubuntu 6.06 LTS + Linux-UVC #170 + Logitech Sphere AF). So tracking 
down the error depends on our descriptions, cooperation and information. 
This is difficult in such a short time.

Perhaps you want to try motion or nakenweb. Those applications should 
also &quot;just work&quot;, but so far I thought the same about my software too ;o)

HTH,
Tom
