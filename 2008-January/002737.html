I'd be more than happy to test that fix you are planning... ;-)

I've read somewhere that there have been some people who tried to
create various patches in order to get this camera to work but you
refused to integrate them because you didn't wanted to taint your
nice code with such ugly and/or occasionally working things which
sounds reasonable.

I ain't got no clue about no nothing but I thought maybe there could
be made an established interface for that like a &quot;workarounds=0x0000&quot;
module parameter where 0x0000 is a bitmask that can be used to enable
or disable the various kludges which iron out such bugs like the ones
that the QC Fusion has. It might happen with various cameras even in
the future that they've got a bug that is ugly to work around or it
is no good for some reason to always work around them in the same way.

Of course the default would be 0x0000 as in no workarounds enabled
for the main driver to be nice and solid but any of them could be
easily enabled and tested by those who need them to get their camera
working. This way they could also get evolved within the broader
linux-uvc community including people who are not able or willing
to patch/hack their kernel sources on their own for example.

What do you think?

Best regards,

Sab
