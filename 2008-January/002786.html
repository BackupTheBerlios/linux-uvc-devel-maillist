Good old Logitech firmware bug :-/

To be completely fair we should rename it the Logitech+SPCA bug as that part 
of the firmware was provided by the chip vendor. Logitech is &quot;only&quot; 
responsible for not testing the devices enough with Linux.

&gt;<i> - after some rmmod/insmod cycles and proper redetection I've started
</I>&gt;<i> Skype without starting any other programs in between. It started to
</I>&gt;<i> work but the picture was distorted, to be more exact, it was stretched
</I>&gt;<i> to about 120% of the original in the Y (vertical) direction from the
</I>&gt;<i> center of the image but basically your code change seems to work! :)
</I>
I'm pretty sure that's not the driver's fault :-) Skype might be stretching 
the picture to fit the fixed-size window.

&gt;<i> I have also tested what luvcview controls work and how:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> brightness - works
</I>&gt;<i> contrast - works
</I>&gt;<i> saturation - works
</I>&gt;<i> gain - works
</I>&gt;<i> sharpness - setting works but no apparent effect
</I>&gt;<i> gamma - adjusted down with effect but then could not be adjusted up anymore
</I>&gt;<i> reset to default - works sometimes (only when camera is in a workable
</I>&gt;<i> state?) pan - ioctl querycontrol error 22
</I>&gt;<i> tilt - ioctl querycontrol error 22
</I>&gt;<i> pan/tilt reset - ioctl querycontrol error 22
</I>
pan/tilt only work if the camera isn't streaming at a resolution higher than 
640x480. Don't ask me why.

&gt;<i> switch light freq filter - works
</I>&gt;<i> exposure - ioctl set control error
</I>&gt;<i> auto exposure - setting works but apparently always remains on
</I>&gt;<i> white balance - ioctl set control error
</I>&gt;<i> auto white balance - setting works but apparently always remains on
</I>
As you experienced the firmware bug, error might be caused by communication 
issues with the camera.

&gt;<i> &gt; The driver already includes workarounds for various broken devices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have a look at the UVC_QUIRK_* macros in uvcvideo.h and how they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; associated with devices in uvc_driver.c.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For early Logitech devices, however, no satisfying workaround has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been find so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see, what I was suggesting wasn't device specific: it's about not having
</I>&gt;<i> to dig up the sources to enable/disable a hack but to be able to control
</I>&gt;<i> them on the module parameter level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have a clue but what I can imagine as a solution for the QC Fusion
</I>&gt;<i> in particular is that it should be detected somehow when the camera gets
</I>&gt;<i> into an unworkable state (failed uvc control queries or failed
</I>&gt;<i> initialization) and then it should be reset or reenumerated. Basically
</I>&gt;<i> doing automatically what one is doing by hand using rmmod/insmod cycles
</I>&gt;<i> when it's apparent from the dmesg that the camera is probably unworkable...
</I>
If there was an easy way to detect and fix those situations I would include a 
workaround in the driver. Unfortunately, all the proposed workarounds often 
fail and they are too intrusive. I don't want to mess the code with a very 
intrusive workaround that don't even work well.

The real problem is that we have no idea today why the camera fails. There is 
a known firmware bug, but there is no explanation as to why the bug isn't 
triggered by Windows and is triggered by Linux.

&gt;<i> By the way recently I have seen various cameras working under
</I>&gt;<i> Windows and apparently several of them are buggy enough to freeze
</I>&gt;<i> or get unworkable within a certain amount of time of submitting
</I>&gt;<i> video. Even original OEM Windows drivers seem to reset these cams
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly (at least it seems like it) as a solution which results
</I>&gt;<i> in temporary video breakages in a video enabled Skype connection.
</I>&gt;<i> So it's not unique to the QC Fusion and Linux I guess...
</I>
I hope those are not UVC cameras. I'd rather have other drivers implement all 
kind of hacks to get them working :-)

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
