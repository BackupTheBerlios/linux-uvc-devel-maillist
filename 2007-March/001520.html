<PRE>Hi Emil,

&gt;<i> I have used SnoopyPro 0.22 to capture USB traffic on a Windows XP
</I>&gt;<i> laptop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started capturing the data from the time the Logitech Quick Cam
</I>&gt;<i> software opened the camera until that it was closed. I was able to
</I>&gt;<i> capture roughly 810 packets during this transmission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have converted the binary log file into text using the usblogdump
</I>&gt;<i> software found at stillhq.com. However, I was only able to convert some
</I>&gt;<i> of that binary log file...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can find the necessary files at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nishra.com/files/Logitech_QuickCam_Ultra_Vision.txt">http://www.nishra.com/files/Logitech_QuickCam_Ultra_Vision.txt</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.nishra.com/files/Logitech_QuickCam_Ultra_Vision.usblog">http://www.nishra.com/files/Logitech_QuickCam_Ultra_Vision.usblog</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you find these files helpful and need me to capture more data, please
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to ask. I'd like to help in getting the Logitech firmware bug
</I>&gt;<i> squashed in the UVC driver.
</I>
First of all, thanks for your help. Unfortunately, this isn't going to be very 
helpful. The hardware bug (it's really a hardware bug, not a firmware one) is 
pretty well known, but no proper solution has been found yet. Windows and 
Linux have different USB stack implementations, which leads to very different 
USB timings between he two platforms. We pretty much known where the problem 
is, but we don't know how to fix it. I believe the most effective solution 
would be to hack the Linux USB stack, but that's definitely not an easy task. 
I'm not sure if this could ever really be fixed.

When discussing the issue with Logitech, the idea of a firmware workaround for 
the hardware bug came up. Unfortunately, that won't help for the webcams that 
have been released already, as the firmware can't be upgraded.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
