<PRE>Hi Martijn,

&gt;<i> &gt; I have a Logitch Quickcam Pro 5000 which runs fine with linux-uvc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drivers, but I was wondering on how to set the JPEG quality it gives.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I'd like is to have uncompressed output, and compress it myself,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but according to luvcview, the YUYV output has size limitations. Is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there any other way to grab a good quality, full-size image? The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bandwidth must be a bottleneck, but the framerate can be low, as I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only interested in still images.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hate to reply to my own post, but after some googling I found that
</I>&gt;<i> v4l2 has an ioctl called VIDIOC_[GS]_JPEGCOMP to get/set the JPEG
</I>&gt;<i> compression level. However, this is not implemented in the linux-uvc
</I>&gt;<i> driver. I tried reading the UVC documentation, but this information
</I>&gt;<i> is a bit too complicated for me. I am willing to test and implement
</I>&gt;<i> this ioctl, but I need help/directions on how to implement this.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone knows?
</I>
You're right, the driver doesn't implement VIDIOC_[GS]_JPEGCOMP yet. Luckily 
for you, it shouldn't be difficult to support those ioctls :-)

The relevant part of the spec is section 4.3.1.1 (UVC 1.1). The compression 
quality is stored in the wCompQuality field, ranging from 0 to 10000. The 
resolution (step) is reported by the device but is currently not retrieved by 
the driver.

The driver negotiates video streaming parameters in uvc_probe_video() 
(uvc_video.c). Have a look at uvc_v4l2_set_streamparm() (uvc_v4l2.c) to see 
how the function is used to set the frame rate. It should be quite easy to 
copy the function and modify it to set the compression quality. You should of 
course add some sanity checks: setting the JPEG compression quality doesn't 
make sense for YUYV.

On a side note, the driver currently sets the quality to the highest value 
supported by the device. If your quality issues come from the JPEG 
compression, you will have to use YUYV. The first generation Logitech webcams 
only supported YUYV streaming at high resolutions. The new ones (2006 and 
later) suport YUYV at all resolutions.

Feel free to ask for more information if you run into any problem. Looking 
forward for your patch :-)

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
