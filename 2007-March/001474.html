<PRE>Hi Paul,

&gt;<i> as much as I would like to see cheap USB webcam based stereo vision, I
</I>&gt;<i> have to agree with you that adherence to standard is crucial. In general
</I>&gt;<i> case we have to assume different values in device and host SOF counters. Do
</I>&gt;<i> you have means (bus analyzer) to test some UVC cameras to find out if these
</I>&gt;<i> counters have the same values?
</I>
There's an easier way. I just plugged two Logitech webcams. Their SOF counters 
seem to be synchronised.

&gt;<i> Maybe all of them or most of them do. In such a case, it would be worthwhile
</I>&gt;<i> to pursue it further.
</I>
Agreed, that would be interesting. Webcams with synchronised SOF counters 
could be marked as such in the driver.

&gt;<i> UVC driver could use time stamps only for these devices.
</I>
The driver should support timestamps for all UVC webcams. Devices which have a 
non-synchronised SOF counter would use the PTS/SCR values to handle clock 
drift. Other devices could be synchronised to the host clock.

&gt;<i> I can provide you with at least one new UVC camera, which is not on official
</I>&gt;<i> list yet (V-Gear TalkCam MX6) for testing.
</I>
Have you tested it ? Does it work ? If so, I can add it to the list on the 
website. Please provide me with the device USB descriptors.

&gt;<i> There seems to be a way to get host system time at SOF Token generation.
</I>&gt;<i> Chapter 6.3 of Open Host Controller Interface Specification for USB
</I>&gt;<i> describes StartOfFrame interrupt event, which could be used for this
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.
</I>
That won't work for EHCI controllers (not sure about UHCI). We need to find 
something else.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
