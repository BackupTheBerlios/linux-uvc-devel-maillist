<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The UVC driver returns the size of the currently set format. So if you do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a S_FMT with 640x480 first, CROPCAP should indeed return 640x480.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The problem with CROPCAP is that for the most part it doesn't apply to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; digital devices. For a while, the call wasn't supported at all but it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; seems that it is mandatory, so we just tried to return _something_ that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; makes sense. If you have any suggestions as to the interpretation of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; V4L2 spec, I'd be happy to hear your view.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently i think very less information is given by uvcvideo driver.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When i applied one by one ioctl's to get what my webcam can supports
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and what not in terms of frame formats, various width and heights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate ? I don't understand what you mean.
</I>
  I mean i have written a v4l2-tool GUI application that will take
video device and apply all available ioctls under v4l2 API and get all
information of attached webcam and display it.
There when i apply CROPCAP ioctl i got 160x120 width and height which
must be 640x480( I am talking about Logitech Quickcam Pro 5000
webcam).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I found if i use  v4l2_enumfrmfmt.h  then i am getting various sizes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is not it possible ti include this header file in uvcviodeo.c and let
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ioctl given in that header file give the various sizes supported by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; webcam hardware. So is it possible to make that VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; included in uvcviudeo.c
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't need to include v4l2_enumfrmfmt.h in uvcvideo.c. v4l2_enumfrmfmt.h
</I>&gt;<i> defines a few new ioctls. Those ioctls will be submitted for inclusion to the
</I>&gt;<i> V4L2 maintainer, so the v4l2_enumfrmfmt.h file is only needed until the
</I>&gt;<i> ioctls will be included in the standard. In other words, if you want to use
</I>&gt;<i> the new ioctls, just include the file v4l2_enumfrmfmt.h in your application
</I>&gt;<i> until those ioctls are added to linux/videodev2.h.
</I>
  That's very nice. Those ioctls must be included then in V4L2 APIs.

[snip]
&gt;<i> &gt; It clearly showed that as MJPG is default frame thru ioclt,s i am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting therefore i am getting the first value in above output as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; width=160 and height=120.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But same output showed max width=640 and height=480. So can it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible to modify ioctl code to return either max values for default
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frame when applied VIDIOC_CROPCAP ??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand what you mean. VIDIOC_CROPCAP should be changed to return the
</I>&gt;<i> sensor size. But that leaves a question: how do we find out the sensor size ?
</I>&gt;<i> It might not be the maximum resolution, as the camera could upscale the
</I>&gt;<i> image. The biggest width/height could also not be available at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine a webcam with a 1024x768 sensor which could do 1024x512 and 800x756
</I>&gt;<i> only ? (I know it sounds weird, but manufacturers sometimes come up with
</I>&gt;<i> weirder things).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So all problems should end in those ioctls which are waiting for their
inclusion in V4L2 API.

&gt;<i> &gt; Or can it be possible in uvcvideo to have max and min width and height
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure members and let them return max and min values. I know it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was case for V4l but not for V4l2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All above are my thought for uvcvideo. This all i am thinking for if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyone want to write a video viewer app then how come he will get that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; info to show streaming video in various supported sizes( Me is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to write video viewer but first to understand all v4l2 API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should use the frame rate enumeration ioctls if you need information
</I>&gt;<i> regarding all the supported formats and sizes. The UVC driver is currently
</I>&gt;<i> the only driver supporting those ioctls, but other drivers will hopefully be
</I>&gt;<i> migrated soon when the ioctls will be submitted for inclusion in the v4l2
</I>&gt;<i> spec.
</I>
Thanks for explanation.
Regards,
Parag.
