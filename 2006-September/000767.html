<PRE>Hi,

Thanks to everyone involved in this driver - its made my cam mostly
work under Linux :)

Im using a Logitech (Orbit I think - devid 046d:08c2) webcam. May I
ask 3 questions please?

1. Im using uvccapture - if I use it too many times to access the
camera, it starts failing to take shots. Its as if the camera has
'hung'.
I get
Unable to set format: 5.
 Init v4L2 failed !! exit fatal

This is AFTER ive had it working in the same session.
Re-plugging the camera fixes it (until next time).
(Is there a way of telling Linux to reset the USB connections - i
would like to be able to fix it remotely via ssh without having to
re-boot the box)

I saw a patch on the mailing list to 'reset the usb' if there is a
problem, but it didnt apply cleanly to the current cvs source. 1 of 5
hunks failed. I could manually work out what needs patching, but I
thought i would try this mailing list to see if its likely to help.

The camera works OK if I run uvccapture in -t 1 mode (ie, continious
shots). It has the cool facility of calling another script after
capture, and waiting for it to finish, so I can use the camera, but I
would rather it worked properly :)

2. The camera is motorised - it does pan and tilt. Ive tried using
setpwc to control it, but it fails.
My guess is that we are waiting for someone to implement the correct
IOCTL calls in the driver. Would I be right?

3. Can anyone reccomend any good motion detection software that works
with this driver? i believe it only supports v4l2, and i cannnot find
any good software that uses that API. I am after something that will
watch the camera, and take a series of stills or a movie when it
detects movement.

Thanks again

George
