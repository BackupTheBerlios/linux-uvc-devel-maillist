Hmmm, you're using Linux 2.6.15, which is not in unstable (anymore),
neither in sarge. Your package manager is seeing the official
linux-uvc-source, which is only present in testing an unstable (not
sarge).

1) What are you using? sarge, testing, sid?

   My package was built for sarge, as you can guess from the apt lines
   Marcel quoted. If you put such lines on a sid system, you have to
   expect problems. Don't do that.

   If you're using sid, well, I could consider rebuilding the package
   and uploading it to my sid repository. I think a simple rebuild would
   be enough. But as a temporary measure, you can still manually install
   the .deb with dpkg.

2) I'm using a 2.6.17 kernel. uvcvideo.c says:

 * Although the driver compiles on 2.6.12, you should use a 2.6.15 or newer
 * kernel because of USB issues.

   but I have not tested anything else than 2.6.17.

3) Finally, there are two ways to avoid the package being replaced by the
   official one when using your favorite apt frontend:

     a) Put the package on hold (in dselect; don't know for the other
        apt frontends). Problem: you won't get *any* update for this
        package until you revert that.

     b) Use apt pinning (cf. howtos referenced by Google).

   I have currently no need for these methods, since I haven't used my
   package in sid so far; only in sarge, where there is no official
   linux-uvc-source package.

If you want more precise help, you'll have to provide more precise data.
