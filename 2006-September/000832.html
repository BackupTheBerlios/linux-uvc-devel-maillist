<PRE>Hi everybody,

I'm happy to announce that the new development branch, called 'split', is 
available in the linux-uvc repository.

- What's new in there ?

The driver has been split into multiple files, making it easier to develop, 
debug and maintain the code.

Control handling has been cleaned up, and the basic infrastructure to support 
more device private controls (defined through extension units) is there. The 
number of UVC compatible devices is expected to grow, and each new device 
might come with some private controls. Modifying the driver every time a new 
control is added might become quite an issue, so I'm working on a way to add 
support for new controls at runtime.

Multiple open is now supported. The first application to call a 
streaming-related ioctl (VIDIOC_S_INPUT, VIDIOC_S_FMT, VIDIOC_TRY_FMT, 
VIDIOC_S_PARM, VIDIOC_REQBUFS) will have exclusive access to streaming 
functions until the device handle is closed. Other applications will still be 
able to query the driver and set controls.

The new extended control API has been implemented. You can now get and/or set 
multiple controls at once. Please remember that the driver is still in a beta 
stage, which means the control IDs might change without notice.

- How to get it ?

Checkout the split branch

svn co <A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/branches/split">svn://svn.berlios.de/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/branches/split</A>

The driver should compile against kernels up to 2.6.18.

Please don't report the warning about uvc_status_complete being defined 
multiple times, I will fix that :-)

- Who should try it ?

Everybody ! I'd like to get as much feedback as possible before merging the 
split branch into the trunk, and submitting the driver to the kernel tree.

Before submitting bug reports, make sure you recompile applications which 
depends on private control IDs and/or private ioctls against the split 
branch.

The driver includes its own version of the extended control ioctls. If you are 
running a kernel in which those ioctls are already included (v4l git tree), 
you will have to remove them from uvc_compat.h.

Happy testing !

Laurent Pinchart
