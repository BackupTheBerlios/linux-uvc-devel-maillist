<PRE>&gt;<i> Thanks to everyone involved in this driver - its made my cam mostly
</I>&gt;<i> work under Linux :)
</I>
In the name of all contributors, thank you :-)

&gt;<i> Im using a Logitech (Orbit I think - devid 046d:08c2) webcam. May I
</I>&gt;<i> ask 3 questions please?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Im using uvccapture - if I use it too many times to access the
</I>&gt;<i> camera, it starts failing to take shots. Its as if the camera has
</I>&gt;<i> 'hung'.
</I>&gt;<i> I get
</I>&gt;<i> Unable to set format: 5.
</I>&gt;<i>  Init v4L2 failed !! exit fatal
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is AFTER ive had it working in the same session.
</I>&gt;<i> Re-plugging the camera fixes it (until next time).
</I>&gt;<i> (Is there a way of telling Linux to reset the USB connections - i
</I>&gt;<i> would like to be able to fix it remotely via ssh without having to
</I>&gt;<i> re-boot the box)
</I>
That's a known problem, for which there's no perfect solution today. 
Developers at Logitech are investigating it, but they have zillions of other 
problems to take care of as well.

&gt;<i> I saw a patch on the mailing list to 'reset the usb' if there is a
</I>&gt;<i> problem, but it didnt apply cleanly to the current cvs source. 1 of 5
</I>&gt;<i> hunks failed. I could manually work out what needs patching, but I
</I>&gt;<i> thought i would try this mailing list to see if its likely to help.
</I>
The patch will definitely help. I hope to find a better fix with Logitech's 
help. In the meantime, you can apply it.

&gt;<i> The camera works OK if I run uvccapture in -t 1 mode (ie, continious
</I>&gt;<i> shots). It has the cool facility of calling another script after
</I>&gt;<i> capture, and waiting for it to finish, so I can use the camera, but I
</I>&gt;<i> would rather it worked properly :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The camera is motorised - it does pan and tilt. Ive tried using
</I>&gt;<i> setpwc to control it, but it fails.
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that we are waiting for someone to implement the correct
</I>&gt;<i> IOCTL calls in the driver. Would I be right?
</I>
Not exactly. The UVC driver already supports pan/tilt through a special 
control, but that will change soon with a new generic IOCTL. I'm working on 
that, stay tuned :-)

&gt;<i> 3. Can anyone reccomend any good motion detection software that works
</I>&gt;<i> with this driver? i believe it only supports v4l2, and i cannnot find
</I>&gt;<i> any good software that uses that API. I am after something that will
</I>&gt;<i> watch the camera, and take a series of stills or a movie when it
</I>&gt;<i> detects movement.
</I>
I heard motion is good, not sure if it supports v4l2 yet.
