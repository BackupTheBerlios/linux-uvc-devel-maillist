<PRE>Hi Andy,

&gt;<i> I need an USB Video Class gadget driver. Upon making inquiries about if
</I>&gt;<i> there is something existing I think I've to write it by myself. Is this
</I>&gt;<i> information correct?
</I>
I think so. I haven't heard of any open-source gadget UVC driver before.

&gt;<i> At the moment I'm using a NET2280 PCI Card later I'll port the drivers to a
</I>&gt;<i> TI Davinci-Chip. I studied several usb gadget drivers. Even so I studied
</I>&gt;<i> the USB Video Class Specification and I had a look at your UVC driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I've got some questions,
</I>&gt;<i> a) What are the minimum settings in my driver that the uvc-driver (host)
</I>&gt;<i> recognize my card as a UVC-Device?
</I>
You need the following features:

- UVC descriptors (obviously). A minimal device should have a camera input 
terminal and an streaming output terminal. You must have either an 
isochronous or bulk endpoint for data transfer.

- Streaming parameters probe/commit. You must implement the probe/commit 
negotiation as described in the UVC standard.

- Video data transfer. Your device must be able to stream video data, either 
in an uncompressed form (YUYV and NV12 are specified by the standard) or a 
compressed form (MJPEG, MPEG2, ...).

That's about it. The Linux UVC driver doesn't require anything else. You don't 
need an interrupt endpoint, you don't need a processing unit.

&gt;<i> b) Is it possible or does it make sense 
</I>&gt;<i> to use your uvc driver as a base-driver? Or do you think the gadegt driver
</I>&gt;<i> is totally different?
</I>
The gadget driver is totally different. You can use the Linux UVC driver to 
test the gadget device, but you won't be able to reuse much code, if any. The 
Linux UVC driver reads the UVC descriptors and sends requests to the device, 
while your driver must provide the descriptors (which can be hardcoded, at 
least partially), and respond to requests.

&gt;<i> c) Which points out of the specification does my driver has to cover at
</I>&gt;<i> least to realize an elementary video stream?
</I>
See answer to point a) above.

&gt;<i> Thank you for your help,
</I>
You're welcome.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
