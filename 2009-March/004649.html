Yes I am aware of the dependencies between video codec and fps and the
resolutions. In my reports2.tar.gz in my previous mails. you can see I
tried both video capture modes of the webcam the video modes are in the
mplayer outputs logs. But to be sure the problem does is not my fault or
my webcams, I would like to have some other test reporst form other users
when they try to use mplayer and mencoder. I sent some basics commands in
my previous mail to the mailinglist, would you be willing to test them?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I upgraded to guvcview 1.0.2 and tested some more there is still the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue that i get lower fps when recording. Could somebody test recording
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 800x600 with 25fps and sound, if its really 25fps the sound will be in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sync.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also i tested the v4l2 fields of the webcam and there are a lot of errors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and non working fields. Is the device really v4l2 compatible? Could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> somebody check this out further?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean by v4l2 fields ? What kind of errors do you get ? Are they 
</I>&gt;<i> pure userspace, or does the driver print error messages to the kernel log as 
</I>&gt;<i> well ?
</I>
See the v4l-info2.log attachment in my previous messages to the list,
there i used some commands to get the v4l2 capabilities but the output is
full with errors, I would really appreciated it if somebody could run
these commands o there working webcams.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also want to use the device on headless machines so no X. How can I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> configure the device then so it does not use auto exposure...?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Use a command line tool such as v4l2-ctl or uvcdynctrl (part of the libwebcam 
</I>&gt;<i> package, make sure you use the SVN version) to change controls.
</I>
I cant find the v4l2-ctl tools! I will look at the libwebcam and hope it
will be worth the investment in time.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I attacked all test reports I made that lead to my conclusions please
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look at them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can be contacted on chat.freenode.org as /msg tuxcrafter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Does somebody know a usb device that can be used for recording with v4l2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capable tools at at-leased 25pfs and 800x600 some auto balancing and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focusing would be nice to.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again please checkout the attachment.
