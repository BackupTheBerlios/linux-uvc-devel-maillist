<PRE>I changed the topic, to make the discussion more transparent. To bad
google has no text only feature, it makes using gmail and mailinglist
conventions a bit hard.

Paulo could you first try to go back to the basics, and check if you can
display an image out of your webcam with mplayer, also please make
reports or the output of the commands, else i can never know what goes
wrong. Setting LANG=en_GB would also help before executions of the
commands :-D And thank you so much for helping.

# first command
$ mplayer -identify -benchmark -v <A HREF="tv://">tv://</A> -tv
driver=v4l2:device=/dev/video0:adevice=/dev/dsp1:immediatemode=0:forceaudio

# second command
mplayer -identify -benchmark -v <A HREF="tv://">tv://</A> -tv
driver=v4l2:device=/dev/video1:adevice=/dev/dsp2:immediatemode=0:forceaudio:width=800:height=600

# third command
$ mencoder <A HREF="tv://">tv://</A> -tv
driver=v4l2:device=/dev/video0:adevice=/dev/dsp1:immediatemode=0:forceaudio:width=800:height=600:fps=25
-oac lavc -ovc lavc -lavcopts
acodec=libmp3lame:abitrate=128:vcodec=mpeg4:vbitrate=2240:threads=4 -of
lavf -lavfopts format=avi -o output7.avi

Make sure auto exposure and all other fps decreasing features are off.
Thanks in advance of the reports, I really need to get mplayer and
mencoder working on higher resolutions and frame rates.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is could mean two things auto exposure is set and fps changes with
</I>&gt;<i> ambient light conditions or a CPU with low horsepower.
</I>
auto exposure was not on, if cpu horsepower is an issue this would be
extreme bad, I also tried to use mencoder and mplayer on a fast headless
server but since i cant get higher resolution or fps i cant test it
correctly.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is not the load, CPU time is scheduled by the system, in the
</I>&gt;<i> case of single core CPUs they really need to be fast enought to process
</I>&gt;<i> video frames and audio and still run all other system processes, for
</I>&gt;<i> multicore CPUs these tasks can be easily scheduled between different
</I>&gt;<i> cores, so you don't need a fast CPU as much.
</I>&gt;<i> A fast transfer disk also helps.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I made some experiments with mpeg encoding in guvcview some time ago and
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to make it work, but I never released the code, since it had
</I>&gt;<i> some heavy requirements for hardware. It's just easy to capture with a
</I>&gt;<i> lightweight encoder ( or even better without any encoding) and compress
</I>&gt;<i> the resulting file later, since this doesn't cause any frame drop.
</I>
I would really like if I can just connect mencoder, mplayer and ffmpeg to
the the guvcview tool, but since guvciew is a GUI tool I cant really use
it. I can only use it for some testing on the client desktops

&gt;<i> Any v4l2 tool should work ! but only libwebcam will enable extension
</I>&gt;<i> controls.
</I>
What are the extension controls, why are those not v4l2? I will try to
make libwebcam work. Does the Creative Cam Optia AF also work with these
tools?

&gt;<i> No, QuickCam Vision Pro has hardware autofocus, in the Pro 9000
</I>&gt;<i> autofucus is done in software, just like the sphere AF, so unless you
</I>&gt;<i> are using guvcview only the Vision will enable autofocus.
</I>
Ok sounds I will buy the  Creative Cam Optia AF or QuickCam Vision Pro
since both seem to be the only 2MP+ webcams with hardware autofocus correct?

Thanks in advance for the test reports,

Jelle de Jong
