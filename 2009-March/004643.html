<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did a lot more testing today (this is full day 5 already) and I found
</I>&gt;<i> some very disturbing discoveries!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can watch the webcam at width=320:height=240:fps=30 and have the
</I>&gt;<i> correct result. However when going over this resolution I will get only
</I>&gt;<i> 15 fps and i can max go to 640x480 resolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any idea why a tool as guvcviewer seems to output 800x600 and even
</I>&gt;<i> 1600x1200 but mplayer does not want go higher as 640x480 (it does go lower)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I believe mplayer checks your hardware and sets resolution accordingly (not
sure about this though).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I upgraded to guvcview 1.0.2 and tested some more there is still the
</I>&gt;<i> issue that i get lower fps when recording. Could somebody test recording
</I>&gt;<i> 800x600 with 25fps and sound, if its really 25fps the sound will be in
</I>&gt;<i> sync.
</I>

In the case of guvcview you should check the resulting fps in the avi
header, use avidemux to check the avi properties.
Sound can become out of sync due to a bad microphone or if fps varies a lot
during capture, guvcview will write the average fps (total number of frames
/ total time of capture) to the avi header.
The quality of video capture is very dependent on your hardware since video
processing requires a lot from ones system (processor, memory, disk, ...),
in your case and although the eeepc is a damn good machine for it's size and
price, I wouldn't consider it a prime candidate for this type of usage.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also i tested the v4l2 fields of the webcam and there are a lot of errors
</I>&gt;<i> and non working fields. Is the device really v4l2 compatible? Could
</I>&gt;<i> somebody check this out further?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Maybe you had some bad luck and bought the 2008 model, this camera has some
serious firmware issues causing all sorts of problems in linux, the 2009
models according to logitech have these problems fixed:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also want to use the device on headless machines so no X. How can I
</I>&gt;<i> configure the device then so it does not use auto exposure...?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you need a command line control application, you should consider
libwebcam:

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I attacked all test reports I made that lead to my conclusions please
</I>&gt;<i> look at them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can be contacted on chat.freenode.org as /msg tuxcrafter
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does somebody know a usb device that can be used for recording with v4l2
</I>&gt;<i> capable tools at at-leased 25pfs and 800x600 some auto balancing and
</I>&gt;<i> focusing would be nice to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you need hardware autofocus, the best one I can remember is the *QuickCam
* Vision Pro, but there is also the creative cam optia AF.
They are both UVC cameras so should do fine in linux.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again please checkout the attachment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for help.
