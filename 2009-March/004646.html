<PRE>Hi Jelle,

</I>
Available resolutions depend on the image format. Your camera supports 
uncompressed YUYV up to 1600x1200 and MJPEG up to 960x720. This doesn't 
explain why MPlayer won't go any higher than 640x480 though, but you should be 
aware that the selected image format affects the available resolutions.

&gt;<i> I upgraded to guvcview 1.0.2 and tested some more there is still the

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
What do you mean by v4l2 fields ? What kind of errors do you get ? Are they 
pure userspace, or does the driver print error messages to the kernel log as 
well ?

&gt;<i> I also want to use the device on headless machines so no X. How can I

</I>
Use a command line tool such as v4l2-ctl or uvcdynctrl (part of the libwebcam 
package, make sure you use the SVN version) to change controls.

&gt;<i> I attacked all test reports I made that lead to my conclusions please
</I>&gt;<i> look at them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can be contacted on chat.freenode.org as /msg tuxcrafter

</I>&gt;<i> Does somebody know a usb device that can be used for recording with v4l2

</I>&gt;<i> focusing would be nice to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again please checkout the attachment.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for help.

Best regards,
