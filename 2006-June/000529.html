Ok, I did some tests ...

MPlayer: That doesn't work because it uses the VIDIOC_G_STD ioctl, which  
doesn't make sense for webcams. You should probably file a bug against the  
MPlayer v4l2 module; it sounds like an easy fix.

Transcode: Transcode's v4l2 source tries the following three image  
formats: YV12, YU12, UYVY. So unless the camera handles one of these,  
you're out of luck. The QuickCam Pro 5000 supports compressed MJPG (Motion  
JPEG) and uncompressed YUY2. Maybe you can get Transcode to accept one of  
those formats? Please let us know if you succeed ...

xawtv: Are you trying to use xawtv itself? That may not work for similar  
reasons as MPlayer, i.e. it tries to do ioctls that were designed for use  
with analog devices. There is a 'webcam' tool as well as a spin-off called  
camE. I haven't really spent a lot of time trying them but if they don't  
work with the UVC driver, you should file bugs against those, too.

Cheers,
Martin
