<PRE>Hi!

I can also confirm that Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 works on Linux.
But I have few (small) issues/quirks.

The first one is that it seems with HD (1920x1080) field of view is
much much smaller then normally. Probably so that it is possible to
pan/tilt it around for face following on Windows. Maybe this is not
configurable, but maybe this is just default and could be turned-off
somehow?

Device supports zoom (at least this is what it tells uvc driver) in
range 1-5, but selecting anything except default (1) makes it simply
hangs when you want to do anything with it. Is this a driver issue?
But device still works and you can select back zoom level 1 and it
works normally then.

The third issue is the most interesting for me. Device supports
2592x1944 (this seems to be native resolution and 1920x1080 is
achieved by using just a part of that and allowing panning and tilling
with moving the area around). In YUYV format it declares itself to
have 2 FPS, but in practice it is only 1 FPS. I have used example
capture program from V4L documentation to experiment with that. I have
compared time when timestamp is put on the buffer in kernel and when
this buffer arrives into my program. Normally this time is around time
length of one frame (1 / FPS). But in the case of 2592x1944 (and not
for lower resolutions) this time is around second. So 500 ms more than
it is normal with other resolutions and cameras is spend somewhere in
the kernel. As I have been just queuing and dequeuing buffers without
doing any processing on them it seems this is really something
internal. As on this resolution FPS is already very low with YUYV
format it would be really great to get that one frame more in.

I use 2.6.36-rc6-amd64 and Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9400 @ 2.66GHz.

Otherwise things work as expected. The only thing I noticed is that
with such high resolution and MJPEG encoding decoding time of frames
is quite visible if you want to decode MJPEG on the fly in real-time.
For example, with libv4l decoding of one pixel of MJPEG to BGR24 takes
around 0.025 microseconds on my machine. This is nothing important
with for example 640x480 resolution, it takes around 7680
microseconds, that is 8 milliseconds. But with 2592x1944 this becomes
around 125 milliseconds. So it is impossible to decode stream n the
fly in real-time with 10 FPS which device supports for this resolution
and MJPEG.

Has anybody tried to improve MJPEG support in libv4l? For example by
using ffmpeg MJPEG decoder? They argue it has better performance:
