<PRE>Hi Nathanael,

</I>
You will have to modify the uvc_ctrls and uvc_ctrl_mappings arrays in 
uvc_video.c

Add an entry to uvc_ctrls with the following fields:

- entity	entity GUID
- selector	UVC control selector (the identifier to be used in requests)
- index		UVC control index in extension unit descriptor bmControls bitfield
- size		UVC control size in bytes
- flags		UVC control flags (see existing controls for examples)

Then add one or more entries to uvc_ctrl_mappings to map the UVC control to 
V4L2 control(s). A single UVC control can be mapped to several V4L2 controls. 
The fields are:

- id		V4L2 control ID
- name		V4L2 control name
- entity	associated UVC control entity GUID
- selector	associated UVC control selector
- size		V4L2 control size in bits
- offset	V4L2 control offset in bits from the UVC control base (*)
- v4l2_type	V4L2 control type
- data_type	V4L2 control field type in the UVC control (**)

(*) A single UVC control can be mapped to several V4L2 controls. For instance, 
a pan/tilt 32-bit (4 bytes) UVC control made of a 16-bit pan value followed 
by a 16-bit tilt value could be mapped to a 16-bit V4L2 pan control and a 
16-bit V4L2 tilt control. The first V4L2 control's offset would be equal to 0 
and the second V4L2 control's offset would be equal to 16.

(**) The currently supported values are UVC_CTRL_DATA_TYPE_SIGNED and 
UVC_CTRL_DATA_TYPE_UNSIGNED. They are used to perform sign extension when 
mapping from signed UVC controls to signed V4L2 controls if the control size 
are not identical.

Finally, modify uvcvideo.h and set V4L2_CID_PRIVATE_LAST equal to your last 
private V4L2 control identifier.

&gt;<i> So far I've added a GUID for the camera's extension unit, as well I've
</I>&gt;<i> added entries to the uvc_ctrl and uvc_ctrl_mappings lists. I've written
</I>&gt;<i> a test application using the V4L2 API to enumerate the controls on the
</I>&gt;<i> camera, and it does see a new control,
</I>
Sounds good so far.

&gt;<i> but I'm not able to use that control. It seems like I'm missing something to
</I>&gt;<i> associate the control with the camera it belongs to.
</I>
What are the symptoms ? Do you get an error when you try to access the 
control ? If so, what error (errno) do you get ?

If you can enumerate the control on your device instance, there should be 
no &quot;association&quot; problem. Try to raise the trace level to 255 (modprobe 
uvcvideo trace=255 or echo 255 &gt; /sys/modules/uvcvideo/parameters/trace) and 
check the kernel log (dmesg) for error messages after you try to access the 
control from your userspace application.

&gt;<i> Hopefully that makes sense, at this point I'm not looking for a really
</I>&gt;<i> elegant solution, I'd just like to hard code it into the driver to do
</I>&gt;<i> some testing.
</I>
The elegant solution is in the dynctrls branch. The idea is to let a userspace 
application configure the driver to add new control mappings at runtime. I 
have to bring the branch up to date, as I haven't worked on it for some time.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
