Have you used the same kernel for both tests ? Could you please try to find 
out which SVN revision introduced the problem ?

</I>
They don't. The Windows USB stack seems to be slower than the Linux one, and 
it just doesn't trigger the problem. It's a matter of timings, and Logitech 
never noticed the problem. From the limited amount of knowledge I have about 
this bug, it seems there is a hardware problem which has been worked-around 
by a firmware hack in recent webcams. Both the hardware and the firmware are 
provided by the IC vendor, so Logitech isn't the only one to blame.

&gt;<i> One wonders *when* manufacturers implement reflashability of their
</I>&gt;<i> monitors, webcams, etc.
</I>
The two issues here are support and cost. They don't want to support firmware 
reflashing, as that would mean replacing dead webcams. And flash costs more 
than ROM.

&gt;<i> Please keep up the good work.
</I>
Thanks. I'll do my best :-)

Regards,

Laurent Pinchart
