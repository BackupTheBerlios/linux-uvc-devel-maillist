Indeed, you're right. Congratulation for reporting issues faster that I can 
fix them ;-)

</I>
The camera has a hardware manual focus. Autofocus is implemented in the 
Windows driver, and is of course missing from the Linux driver.

There are two things to implement in Linux to get something similar. The first 
one is to implement manual focus into the driver. This shouldn't be difficult 
and I'll have a go at it. The second one is much more complex. You'll have to 
come up with a userspace image processing algorithm to compute focus values 
from the video. I have no experience with that.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
