<PRE>&gt;<i> But right now, I can tell you for certain, that when the UVC driver
</I>&gt;<i> worked &quot;for periods of multiple minuttes at a time&quot;, I wrote to mr.
</I>&gt;<i> Xhaard asking about the luvcview output with cc to this list about this
</I>&gt;<i> very problem.  This was Friday 20. July - I see from my earlier posting,
</I>&gt;<i> that my kernel was the current &quot;2.6.21-1.3228.fc7&quot;.  So no kernel changes
</I>&gt;<i> was made in between.  An instance of the UVC driver working &quot;for periods
</I>&gt;<i> of a few seconds only&quot; is the one which I checked out from the
</I>&gt;<i> Subversion repository last night about 12 hours ago.  From my point of
</I>&gt;<i> view, something has changed in between.  I have not reconfigured the
</I>&gt;<i> physical USB setup or anything like that, but I have been playing around
</I>&gt;<i> with other (USB) drivers (I say this because you mention, that the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is somehow related to timing; maybe something else than changes
</I>&gt;<i> in the UVC source code triggered something).
</I>
For what it's worth, my camera's problems seem to be completely different:
I only ever have problems when opening the device (e.g. when starting
luvcview), where it regularly gives me an error, but once the video is
streaming it'll stream just fine for hours on end.

At least that's what I get with luvcview and ekiga (the only 2 applications
I've ever used with my camera).
