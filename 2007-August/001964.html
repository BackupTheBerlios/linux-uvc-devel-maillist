Yes, I am pretty certain, that I used the same kernel for both tests. My
Fedora 7 system did have its kernel upgraded at some point some weeks
back from... a 2.6.19 to a 2.6.21, I belive out from memory. But this
kernel-upgrade was weeks before I changed UVC drivers, I think.

Yes, I will try to find out which SVN revision made a difference. I can
try it out within a day or two, I expect. 

But right now, I can tell you for certain, that when the UVC driver
worked &quot;for periods of multiple minuttes at a time&quot;, I wrote to mr.
Xhaard asking about the luvcview output with cc to this list about this
very problem. This was Friday 20. July - I see from my earlier posting,
that my kernel was the current &quot;2.6.21-1.3228.fc7&quot;. So no kernel changes
was made in between. An instance of the UVC driver working &quot;for periods
of a few seconds only&quot; is the one which I checked out from the
Subversion repository last night about 12 hours ago. From my point of
view, something has changed in between. I have not reconfigured the
physical USB setup or anything like that, but I have been playing around
with other (USB) drivers (I say this because you mention, that the
problem is somehow related to timing; maybe something else than changes
in the UVC source code triggered something).

I will *try* to narrow this down relative to SVN revisions.

Morten Sabroe Mortensen

Hi Morten,

Have you used the same kernel for both tests ? Could you please try to
find 
out which SVN revision introduced the problem ?

&gt;<i> One wonders how Logitech circumvents the problem in their Windows
</I>drivers.

They don't. The Windows USB stack seems to be slower than the Linux one,
and 
it just doesn't trigger the problem. It's a matter of timings, and
Logitech 
never noticed the problem. From the limited amount of knowledge I have
about 
this bug, it seems there is a hardware problem which has been
worked-around 
by a firmware hack in recent webcams. Both the hardware and the firmware
are 
provided by the IC vendor, so Logitech isn't the only one to blame.

&gt;<i> One wonders *when* manufacturers implement reflashability of their
</I>&gt;<i> monitors, webcams, etc.
</I>
The two issues here are support and cost. They don't want to support
firmware 
reflashing, as that would mean replacing dead webcams. And flash costs
more 
than ROM.

&gt;<i> Please keep up the good work.
</I>
Thanks. I'll do my best :-)

Regards,

Laurent Pinchart
