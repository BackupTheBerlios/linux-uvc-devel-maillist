<PRE>I am getting frequent crashes with this camera. The kernel log contains
various USB errors (a crash always leads to all USB devices reseting,
but the camera stays dead afterwards until next reboot). The program
that was using the camera cannot be killed. The LED on my USB hub on the
port with the camera on it is blinking after the crash (other LEDs are
off, if no device is connected, or on if a device works). Connecting the
camera to some other USB port does not help, it still gives a blinking LED.

It is possible that I (a) have generic USB issues, not related to UVC at
all, or that (b) all UVC cameras have the same issue (I don't have any
others to test).

P.S. for anybody considering buying this camera - DO NOT. The picture
quality is not very good, but the auto focus is a real problem. It keeps
refocusing the image, even though it is already in focus. The focusing
does not focus directly, but instead runs the focus servo from one end
to the other, very slowly. Because of this, your image will be blurry
most of the time even at 320x240. And the optics are so bad that the
focus does not only focus, but also zooms a bit while doing it.

The Logitech 2 megapixel camera (Quickcam Pro for Notebooks, I think)
has in every way far superior image quality and the device costs about
the same as this Creative crap. However, it, too, has one important
drawback - it scans the image a line at a time (not a frame at a time),
so you get ugly distortion whenever anything in the image (or the camera
itself) moves. Creative does not have this problem, but its other issues
are still far worse than that.

Can anyone recommend a truly good webcam? I am looking for high frame
rates at high resolutions (VGA is not acceptable), good optics, etc.
Ethernet is optimal, USB2 and FW/FW800 are OK (as long as they work in
Linux). The price roof is around 300 &#8364;.
