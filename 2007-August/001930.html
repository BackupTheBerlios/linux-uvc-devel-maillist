There is still an unresolved issue that holds the driver back. Unfortunately, 
the issue isn't with the driver itself, but with the V4L2 specification.

UVC defines standard controls such as brightness and contrast. Most of them 
are included in V4L2, but some of them are missing. As those controls are 
defined by the UVC specification (as opposed to being vendor-specific), and 
as UVC devices are going to be more and more common, I believe they should be 
added to the V4L2 specification. I posted a proposal on the V4L2 mailing list 
a few months ago to add new standard controls, but it has been rejected after 
a hot debate.

The missing controls are currently implemented as private controls. Once the 
driver is included in the kernel, it will be difficult to change them. That's 
why I'd like to resolve this last blocking issue before submitting the 
driver.
