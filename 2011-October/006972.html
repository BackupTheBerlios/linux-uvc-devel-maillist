<PRE>Hello,

I had few queries regarding the UVC support for H264 video stream. Please
help me in resolving this. (I am just getting started with linux. Not much
experienced in it. So please bear with my basic questions )

1:  I understand that for the raw video formats, i can use the V4L2 APIs to
get the things done for me. For MJPG i can use V4L2_PIX_FMT_MJPEG. But from
the V4L2 API specification document, i could not find any APIs provided for
H264 video streaming from the camera.
    -&gt; Am i missing something ? Is there an V4L2 API available to get the
H264 streaming from my camera(Ofcourse my camera is H264 capabe) ? Is this
support vendor specific or generic ?  Or Is H264 support is not very matured
at UVC/V4L2 ?

2: When i was going through the USB_Video_Payload_H264_1.0.pdf, i came
across UVCX_VIDEO_CONFIG_PROBE/
UVCX_VIDEO_CONFIG_COMMIT APIs. I am using *kernel 2.6.31*.
   -&gt; Are these generic APIs? Is there any generic patch i can apply to my
uvc, if any, to call these APIs at my application to achieve H264 video
streaming ?
   -&gt; For me to call this APIs from my application, should i have to take
care of any dependencies (codec specifics) ? Like what device type to be
open (/dev/video) to read the video stream from the camera ? Is there any
sample H264 video capture which can help me in this ?
   -&gt; Can i use V4L2 and UVCX both together ?

Awaiting for the response!. Thanks in advance!

( Note: Sometime back regarding one of my H264 questions to the UVC group. I
did receive an reply from Ajay Bhargav directing me to a mail thread of H264
discussion and some patches on V4L2 for achieving the H264. But i didnot
find those files for which the patches were available in my kernel version.
:<i>-(. I do have the UVC code but not sys/v4l2. And i do not want to upgrade
</I>my kernel version )

Thanks,
Harshitha HS
