<PRE>Hello list,

The above two cameras, which have the well known usb bandwidth bug under 
Linux don't seem to display the same problems under Windows. I've tried 
them under Windows Vista and Windows 7 32bit. I've managed to display a 
LifeCam Studio and LifeCam Cinema at the same time through separate 
instances of VLC all the way to 1920x1080 for LifeCam Studio and 
1280x720 for the LifeCam Cinema - which I believe are the maximum video 
resolutions for both cameras. I've forced VLC on 25fps - and the Cinema 
seems to do that. However, looking at the footage from the Studio at 
maximum resolution - it looks more like 5fps.

However, what all the above means is that these cameras don't seem to 
suffer from the usb bandwidth bug under Windows. I've input &quot;mjpg&quot; under 
chroma settings for VLC - but I can't find a way to tell for sure if VLC 
is using the mjpeg stream from the camera, or raw.

Can someone here help me push this further? Is there any way of 
debugging what is happening under Windows - so that maybe the Linux uvc 
driver can be modified to get these cameras to work properly?

Any suggestions much appreciated.

Sebastian
