Just resurrecting this old thread which I've started a while ago. I am 
now the owner of 5 Microsoft LifeCam Studio webcams. Let me restate that 
- I am now the frustrated owner of 5 Microsoft LifeCam Studio webcams. 
The other reviews were right - the image quality of this webcam is 
absolutely excellent. However, I just can't get them working more then 
one at a time. I've just about managed to get one LifeCam Studio working 
together with an integrated laptop webcam. When I try to get two LifeCam 
Studio working together - I get the old &quot;no space left on device&quot; or 
&quot;device busy&quot; error message - depending on what software I'm using.

I've tried VLC (with chroma=mjpeg and without it), 640x480 and 800x600 
resolutions, and went all the way down to 1fps. I've tried 
mjpg_streamer. It all ends up the same. The newest kernel I've tried is 
2.6.39.

To me, it looks like this camera suffers from the same bug as Microsoft 
LifeCam Cinema.

1. Could anybody here having a LifeCam Studio (more then one would be 
even better) run again some tests and either confirm or disprove my 
findings.
2. Could someone suggest some thorough tests I could run - so that at 
least this camera gets marked on the list of supported devices as having 
a bug - like the LifeCam Cinema is flagged at the moment? It will at 
least save someone else buying a bucket load of them :-(

Thank you for any suggestions.

Sebastian
