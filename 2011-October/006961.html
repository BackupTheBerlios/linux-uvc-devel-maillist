perhaps the 2nd camera is on the pci bus or an i2c bus?
lspci tells the former, i don't know how to determine the latter.
does dmesg show anything suspicious?

it seems a little odd to me to use the same sensor for cameras pointing
in different directions, wouldn't it take some mirrors or something?
vga resolution cameras are probably dirt cheap. just guessing though...

can you take it apart far enough to see if it looks like one or two  
cameras?

maybe one of the android phone forums would have an idea since they
presumably handle phones with similar setups?
