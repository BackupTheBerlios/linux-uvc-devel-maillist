</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;From reading the manpage on lsusb, it appears that all usb devices  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; listed: even those that don't have drivers. Because there is no second

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forward facing and rear facing camera. This suggests to me there must  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a way to tell the device *which* physical camera to use for input.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alternatively, perhaps the single device &quot;publishes&quot; two separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; streams. Perhaps this is not part of UVC. Is there anything in the UVC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec that provides an interface for switching between two  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inputs/streams
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the same USB device? Is there anything in the linux UVC driver that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allows for this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the 2nd camera is on the pci bus or an i2c bus?
</I>&gt;<i> lspci tells the former, i don't know how to determine the latter.
</I>&gt;<i> does dmesg show anything suspicious?
</I>Good idea. I guess I just *assumed* it would be on USB. LSPCI shows only
the graphics controller stuff, the usb controllers, ISA Bridge, IDE
interface, crystal HD, and network controller. dmesg didn't show
anything suspicious. Grepping around syslog didn't show much either. I
can see where the &quot;HP Webcam&quot; is found and where uvc logs some things
about it. But there isn't anything in there about another device, or
warnings about something found but without a driver or anything.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> it seems a little odd to me to use the same sensor for cameras pointing
</I>&gt;<i> in different directions, wouldn't it take some mirrors or something?
</I>&gt;<i> vga resolution cameras are probably dirt cheap. just guessing though...
</I>I wouldn't suspect that they use the same sensor. You're right that
would probably be weird. I just figured that there was a single hardware
controller for both physical cameras.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> can you take it apart far enough to see if it looks like one or two  
</I>&gt;<i> cameras?
</I>Unfortunately not. It's a tablet pc and it's got this flashy outer
casing that doesn't look like I could take it apart without doing any
damage.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe one of the android phone forums would have an idea since they
</I>&gt;<i> presumably handle phones with similar setups?
</I>Good idea, I should ask there as well.
