<PRE>Sorry to bump, but I haven't gotten any reply. Is there anyone who has
any experience with a dual/camera setup... forward + rear facing
(similar to a smartphone). 

&gt;<i>From reading the manpage on lsusb, it appears that all usb devices are
</I>listed: even those that don't have drivers. Because there is no second
device listed in lsusb, I suspect that 10f1:1a26 is in fact *both* the
forward facing and rear facing camera. This suggests to me there must be
a way to tell the device *which* physical camera to use for input.
Alternatively, perhaps the single device &quot;publishes&quot; two separate
streams. Perhaps this is not part of UVC. Is there anything in the UVC
spec that provides an interface for switching between two inputs/streams
on the same USB device? Is there anything in the linux UVC driver that
allows for this?

Thanks
