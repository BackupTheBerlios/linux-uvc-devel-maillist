Message-ID: <38E10A4A-280C-4C30-964F-648C99CBB02C@declareSub.com>

I'm trying to call luvcview -f yuv to test support for that format.   
The process exits with the following error information.

format asked unavailable get width 1024 height 576
X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for  
operation)
   Major opcode of failed request:  140 (XVideo)
   Minor opcode of failed request:  19 ()
   Serial number of failed request:  26
   Current serial number in output stream:  27

Presumably somebody can't get enough memory to do something.  But  
also I cannot seem to set the resolution to anything smaller for YUYV  
format.  Is this in fact not possible to do (I'm using a Logitech  
QuickCam Fusion)?

You probably compiled uvcvideo with a configuration which doesn't match the 
kernel you are running. Your kernel has been compiled without 
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT while uvcvideo has been compiled with the symbol 
defined. Have you modified the kernel sources configuration after upgrading 
to 2.6.16.11 ?

You're probably seing the AGC being turned on. Skipping the first few frames 
is the only method I know of to solve this problem.

luvcview is unable to allocate enough XVideo memory from the X server to 
display the image.

YUYV doesn't support smaller resolutions. That's a hardware/firmware 
limitation and I can't do anything about it in the driver, sorry.

Subject: [Linux-uvc-devel] [SVN] Frame rate selection
Message-ID: <200605022232.09962.laurent.pinchart@skynet.be>

Hi everybody,

it's been a long time since the last [SVN] e-mail (which doesn't mean there 
hasn't been any commit in the meantime, but nothing worth bothering you all), 
so here's a new toy to play with :-)

The driver now supports frame rate selection through VIDIOC_G_PARM and 
VIDIOC_S_PARM. The frame rate will be reset to a default value when selecting 
a new video format (VIDIOC_S_FMT), so those ioctls should only be used after 
selecting the video format. Be aware that changing the frame rate could 
theorically change the maximum buffer size reported by the hardware, so 
applications should query the driver for the maximum buffer size after 
changing the frame rate:

VIDIOC_S_FMT - Set the image format
VIDIOC_S_PARM - Set the frame rate
VIDIOC_G_FMT - Get the maximum buffer size

Please report any problem, crash or heart attack caused by this patch (but be 
aware that there's probably not much I can do about heart attacks).

Cool, great news.

I have one question which I've been meaning to ask you.  As far as I can
tell, the V4L2 API has no way of enumerating the possible frame rates or
frame sizes that a device supports.  Does this bother you as much as it
bothers me?  Obviously, it's not necessary for all types of devices, but
it's useful for many.  Do you have any thoughts on the subject?  Perhaps
a new V4L2 ioctl should be proposed, or some sort of hardware-specific
extension capability to the API?

Regards,

David

How about 2:1 downsample support? Should be relatively easy to do.

Maybe not as muc, but it does.

I think we should propose a new ioctl. Do you want to write a draft ? :-)

The purpose of the V4L2 api is to expose the hardware capabilities and
nothing more.  Any downsample support should be added to the
application.

Hossa.

Since my old ebuilds were on my crappy DSL line and that kinda sucked, I
put up a website for them at
http://www.the-gay-bar.com
There you can get ebuilds for a SVN checkout as well as ebuilds with
"stable" package numbers (for example the first one from today called
uvcvideo-20060502. I hope those "stable" packaged files will make
getting it included in the real gentoo portage tree easier as well as
might make it easier to track bugs people might encounter with different
Kernel versions.

I hope it helps someone, please contact me in case something does not
work for you.

Thanks!

I agree with that sentiment to some extent, but in the other extreme you may 
have some very esoteric hardware which does not support any regular format. 
This will mean semi-specialized applications written for it. Surely that's 
not good either?

There's always room for a userspace library to be developed that wraps
the V4L2 API and would have these types of conversions.  And in an ideal
world, everyone would use a library such a gstreamer to develop their
applications, which would automatically handle it.

One reason for not doing it in the driver is how does the
application-writer know he is getting the most efficient code?  For
example, if the driver converted this esoteric format into RGB, it might
use a good amount of CPU time doing so.  However, maybe the user's GPU
can do the same work almost for free.  Thus, the application writer
would rather use the GPU -- but if the driver abstracts that decision
away, there's no way for the application writer to know what the fastest
code path is.

It looks like fswebcam was built without V4L2 support, probably caused
by a bug in the configure script. If you can send me a copy of the
'config.log' off-list I'll have a look.

Is this the result of something I've done incorrectly?  I'd like to

Hi all, 

just writing in to report some big improvements I've noticed.

My setup:
Logitech Quickcam Fusion
Kernel 2.6.15.3 (from kernel.org)
uvcvideo revision 34
Kopete 0.12 beta 2

I noticed that with some older versions of the driver if I opened the device 
config window, then closed it, and opened it again kopete would crash or the 
video overlay would go green. This no longer happens.

I also see no errors in dmesg or logs.

So, props to the developers! Now all I need is for Kopete to scale the image 
and I'll buy a round of beers ;)

You should upgrade to the latest version. The message is a leftover of 
debugging code.

This is harmless, the debug message was committed by accident. Just update  
to the latest version and it will disappear ... :-)

Hey Nick,

Could you elaborate a little on that? What version(s) did you try before  
and do you remember any of the errors in the syslog? Were they of the  
https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2006-April/000450.html

"Failed to query" errors if that's in fact what you were experiencing.  
Thanks!

Hi Martin,

yes, that was exactly the error I was getting. Unfortunately I'm not sure 
which revision it was with...was just happy it was fixed. I do remember 
writing in about it using rev 19, and received a temporary patch from 
Alexandre Becoulet that reset the USB (not sure if it just reset the one 
device or the whole subsystem?). That worked with a small delay waiting for 
the reset. I don't know if that's any help as rev 19 is ancient history 
now :)

Hi all,

It seems that aMsn use the same ioctl call in its capture library.
Because of this error, I can't select my Fusion webcam.

Is this call is purely V4L1? Do i need remove it from aMsn source?

Thanks

Hi Laurent,

I've got a question regarding the pan/tilt control of
the Logitech Orbit MP - luvcview only allows to
control the camera in the 640x480 mode. Will it be
possible in the 1024x576 mode or is it a hardware
limitation?

Thanks,

That's a V4L1 call, yes. You can try removing it. Try contacting the aMsn 
developers.

Could you please post the webcam USB descriptors ? You can get them with

lsusb -d 046d: -v

Subject: [Linux-uvc-devel] Fedora Extras kmod RPM
Message-ID: <1147750638.7672.23.camel@home-desk>

Before I begin creating an RPM from this project, I thought I would ask
the list if there is anyone working on one for Fedora Extras already?

I am using UVC with a logitech QuickCam Pro 5000 (USB ID 046d:08c5) and
it works great.  I thought I would try to help out other folks who would
like to use Ekiga(gnome-meeting) with a good camera/driver under Fedora
Core 5.

Message-ID: <4469D8EE.2040008@gmx.net>

hello list!
in the archiv i found someone asking for adding support for the
(logitech) 046d:0892 webcam. this is the webcam in the acer travelmate
8204. and the reply was a request for some debug output. since that
doesn't appear in the archiv i figure it was never sent. this is the
output from the commandline in the subject.
besides the output below i got a "can't get debug descriptor: Connection
timed" is that bad? how can i fix it?

Hi,

I think I've accidentally hit the 'reply' instead of the 'reply all'  
button, so the answer didn't get through to everybody. Sorry about that ...

The camera you're talking about does not support UVC and will therefore  
not work with the Linux
UVC driver.

However, Michel Xhaard, the author of the SPCA5xx driver  
(http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca5xx.html) is
currently looking into adding support for this type of camera. So with a  
little bit of luck and
Michel's great work you should be able to use it in the not too far future.

Cheers,
Martin

Hi Sean,

Not that I know of, but I'm not a Fedore Core user so I can't tell for sure.

Thanks for your help :-)

Hi Geoffrey,

> I'd like to know if the quickcam pro 4000 will be supported.

The Quickcam Pro 4000 is an old generation webcam. It's not compatible with 
the USB Video Class standard, and will thus not be supported by the linux-uvc 
driver.

There is, however, a Linux driver already available for the webcam. A quick 
search on Google with the "QuickCam Pro 4000 Linux" keywords should be enough 
to help you.

Message-ID: <20060524142858.GA27137@suse.cz>

Hello,

as I hobby, I'm doing robotics research. So far, we've used an Orange
Micro iBot2 webcam on our robot, which has an OV7620 sensor connected to
USB 2.0 via a simple bridge implemented in the Cypress Semi EzUSB FX2
microprocessor. 

This setup allows us to get the raw unprocessed data from the OV7620 VGA
CMOS sensor in Bayer format - one byte per pixel, when the sensor is
programmed right (via its i2c registers). (We also were able to do full
VGA resolution at 60 fps, but I don't expect that'll be possible on any
other camera ...)

This saves us both USB and RAM bandwidth, because in Bayer mode we only
send 640x480 bytes, while YUYV mode needs 640x480x2 bytes.

Unfortunately, the iBot2 is no longer manufactured.

So the question is: Is it possible to get the raw data out of the
QuickCam Pro 5000 CCD VGA sensor?

Just to be curious, what is the CPU/Hardware able to carry a VGA stream at 60 
fp/s on your robot ?

I did not know the QC Pro 5000 but the QC Pro for Notebook from Logitech can 
be set to provided 1024x576 in YUYV mode this webcam size is also a good 
point for a robot :)

Oh, an Athlon64 at 2GHz was able to do that, and process the data as
well. 60fps at VGA resolution in Bayer format is some 18 megabytes of
data per second - it's easily feasible.

Note: Zero-copy delivery to userspace is a must at these data rates, so
my driver for the iBot delivers data directly via DMA to the processing
application, without ever copying it inside the kernel.

Yes, but 1024x576 YUYV is still 35 megabytes per second at 30fps, twice
as much data for half the frame rate. I admit that the resolution is
much nicer than VGA, but that is not something I need that much.

My primary objectives are: Vivid colors (for good object recognition)
and high frame rate (for fast response of the robot).

Getting a raw Bayer image is strangely not part of the UVC spec, and is
thus not supported on the Quickcam Pro 5000 as best as I can tell.

It sounds like you may have used an undocumented feature to trick your
iBot into giving raw output, and it's possible there's a similar hack
for the Quickcam.  In the end, it may not save bandwidth however because
the Quickcam Pro 5000 seems to always allocate more isochronous
bandwidth than it really needs.  I suppose this is an attempt to reduce
per-frame latency.

Interesting.  The UVC driver does one copy, which is to extract the
frame data out of the urb's packets and parse headers, etc.

Does that mean for the iBot you do even this low-level packet parsing
inside the application instead of the driver?

The Quickcam Pro 5000 doesn't provide a documented way to return data in raw 
Bayer format.

I'll ask Logitech if there is some backdoor available.

Even if the webcam allocates more bandwidth than needed, the amount of data to 
transfer, copy and process will be reduced, as well as the number of 
interrupts generated.

No, the URBs are set up so that the data is DMA'd in the right order to
the user buffers. The iBot doesn't send any headers in the packets,
just the data. So the application always sees contiguous frame data.

I didn't use V4L2 for the interface, since it was too much work for the
simple task I needed to solve, so I don't know if the approach would
work with it.

I also haven't studied the UVC specification or the driver deeply enough
yet, but if the headers as you mention would get in the way, the copy
may be unavoidable. It might be possible to set up an URB just for the
header, though, and another for the data in the ISO transfer.

I find that somewhat strange, too, but it's possible the authors of the
spec did want to hide/abstract the internal workings of the camera.

It'd be nice if there was one. Most digital still cameras do have the
feature of obtaining the raw image - I'd expect it to be very useful for
webcams as well - more advanced filtering and interpolation can be done
by the main CPU than the builtin microprocessor.

When I set the camera to the 60Hz mode, I'm definitely operating it in a
mode the manufacturer didn't expect. The raw RGB mode is the native mode
of that camera, though.

Still, it's hard to call it an undocumented feature, because the
firmware in the iBot uP only can shuffle data from the video bus to USB,
and do I2C reads/writes to the sensor chip, nothing else.

I expected that. Still I wanted to ask. YUYV is nicer for processing
(object recognition) than Bayer, but has double the data rate.

Of course for 1.3 Mpix cameras running at 640x480 YUYV makes more sense,
because there it carries non-redundant information. Not so with VGA
cameras.

Which makes me wonder: How does the image quality of the Fusion/Orbit MP
compare to the Pro 5000?

Thanks. I've had good relations with Logitech in the past - I wrote the
Linux drivers for their joysticks and mice - they're rather nice guys
and at least the engineers support Linux efforts.

That's neat.  I didn't realize there was a webcam out there with such
low-level access to the hardware.

That's true.  I was mostly thinking of the case where you might want to
have two identical cameras running on the same USB bus.  The Quickcam
Pro 5000 unfortunately takes more than 50% of the isochronous bandwidth
when it's running in uncompressed mode, so you're limited to one camera
at a time.

The Fusion provides a much sharper picture than the Pro 5000, even when
both are at 640x480.  Unfortunately, the fusion seems to have a wacky
built-in white balance algorithm that makes its colors seem much uglier
than the Pro 5000.  This might just be a weird interaction with the
Linux drivers, but I haven't had a chance to see if the problem happens
on Windows also.

Anything based on the reference OmniVision USB2 design is like that.
That includes Trust SpaceC at m 380, for example. But even that one is
rather hard to find nowadays.

The problem with this design was that it was released too early - in the
days USB2 was not widely available. And since the design can't do
compression, it's results on USB1.1 are rather pathetic.

For that reason, both the iBot2 and the Trust 380 are out of production
now, replaced by designs based on the Ali M5603c (for which a Linux
driver is still missing).

That's bad. More than one EHCI controller is still an exception on
modern mainboards. Maybe I'll be able to cheat a little and allocate
less for the camera. 

If it can do just 640x480 YUYV, two streams should fit on one USB2 bus.
(that's 2*18=36 MB/sec, that should still fit into the 480 Mbit/sec,
even with bitstuffing).

It's a CMOS chip, it's bound to have color issues. For example the
OV7620 used in the iBot has quite severe leakage between adjacent cells
of the sensor, causing green pixels to behave differently based on their
position within the Bayer pattern. The chip then has (analog) matrix
processing available to correct for this and a number of other problems
inherent to the CMOS sensor technology.

A lot of that can be avoided by using CCD (like the Pro 5000), but of
course, the CCD is significantly more expensive, most likely a VGA CCD
is on par cost-wise with 1.3 Mpix CMOS.

Yup, that was my reasoning as well.  Unfortunately during the UVC
negotiation phase, it asks for more bandwidth than that.  I tried
overriding it's request and giving it less than it asked for, but in
that case I got nothing from the camera.

Feel free to experiment yourself -- I forget whether I tried that with
the Pro 5000, or just the fusion.

Maybe Logitech will release a firmware upgrade to solve this problem.

I should be able to give you some information as to whether or not that  
works at the beginning of next week. Sorry for the delay, but we have a  
busy week here ... :-)

See above :-)

Hi,

you say on your website that the "Source code for the Linux UVC kernel driver can be found in the Linux UVC Subversion repository on the BerliOS project page."
Unfortunately I cannot find any source code on the related site. There (http://developer.berlios.de/projects/linux-uvc) it says "This Project Has Not Released Any Files".

Can you tell me where I really can download sorce code of this project?

Thanks very much.
Regards,
Oliver Scheid

There has not yet been an official snapshot. So you got two alternatives:
You can get the current version from the SVN repository like this:
"svn co http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/"
or you can download a snapshot from my Homepage
(http://the-gay-bar.com/distfiles/).

Has anyone been able to capture video from a Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000?

I've tried many v4l2 compatible programs like:
http://www.mplayerhq.hu/
http://www.transcoding.org/
http://linux.bytesex.org/xawtv/

But I always get something like:
VIDIOC_S_FMT: : Invalid argument

Could you let me know programs with its version number you have been
able to successfully capture a video(+audio) stream to .avi or .mpg
?

If MPlayer or Transcode work for you please let me know.

When I say "capture" I just mean streaming video, usually to a display. I  
haven't tried writing to AVI or MPG files but that part is quite unrelated  
to V4L2 or the UVC driver itself, so I can't help you a lot with that part.

GStreamer has an avimux plugin, so with the right pipeline you should be  
able to write webcam streams into AVI files. If you just want to display  
the video on the screen, try something like:
	gst-launch v4l2src ! xvimagesink

I'm using the CVS version of GStreamer 0.10 here.

Cheers,
Martin

  Hi,
  
  I bought a Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks pro, and
I want to try your drivers, but I couldn't find them
in the project page.
  Thank you very much,
