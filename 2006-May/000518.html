Anything based on the reference OmniVision USB2 design is like that.
That includes Trust <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/linux-uvc-devel">SpaceC at m</A> 380, for example. But even that one is
rather hard to find nowadays.

The problem with this design was that it was released too early - in the
days USB2 was not widely available. And since the design can't do
compression, it's results on USB1.1 are rather pathetic.

For that reason, both the iBot2 and the Trust 380 are out of production
now, replaced by designs based on the Ali M5603c (for which a Linux
driver is still missing).

&gt;<i> &gt; Linux enforces bandwidth allocation only optionally, and even when it

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it was pre-allocated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's true.  I was mostly thinking of the case where you might want to

</I>&gt;<i> Pro 5000 unfortunately takes more than 50% of the isochronous bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> when it's running in uncompressed mode, so you're limited to one camera
</I>&gt;<i> at a time.
</I> 
That's bad. More than one EHCI controller is still an exception on
modern mainboards. Maybe I'll be able to cheat a little and allocate
less for the camera. 

If it can do just 640x480 YUYV, two streams should fit on one USB2 bus.
(that's 2*18=36 MB/sec, that should still fit into the 480 Mbit/sec,
even with bitstuffing).
