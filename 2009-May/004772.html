<PRE> Hello Laurent

  Given that if this webcam was working  should I expect the command

     &gt;luvcview

  to then work?

  Okay. I did a:

      hg clone <A HREF="http://linuxtv.org/hg/~pinchartl/uvcvideo/">http://linuxtv.org/hg/~pinchartl/uvcvideo/</A>

 Then I did

 mv /lib/modules /lib/modules.HIDE
 make modules (from the kernel tree)
 etc.

to get rid of any modules.  I don't use modules if I can help it and a
a search for *.ko gave a dummy.ko and some scsi_something_or_other.ko
I then built the  tree and installed it.
   make
   make install

and after booting:

  modprobe  uvcvideo

dmesg gives

   uvcvideo 4-1:1.0: usb_probe_interface
   uvcvideo 4-1:1.0: usb_probe_interface - got id
   uvcvideo: Found UVC 1.00 device Crystal Eye webcam (064e:a103)
   input: Crystal Eye webcam as /class/input/input7
   usbcore: registered new interface driver uvcvideo
   USB Video Class driver (v0.1.0)

   (Begin: lsusb stuff)
&gt;&gt;<i> which is the same as my webcam but the devices are not the same. Below I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> includea diff of the two listings.
</I>
&gt;<i>     That doesn't surprise me much, vendors often change devices
</I>&gt;<i>     without modifying the PID or the version.
</I>
Okay. I then assume even though the USB listing is different
the webcam should function. If you do want a complete lsusb
listing for your records let me know.
   (End: lsusb stuff)

I have been looking at this frontwards, backwards,
upsidedown and around and still haven't got it working. At
this point my feeling is that there is nothing wrong with
the uvcvideo driver ( at least in terms of getting crystal
eye webcam basic functionality ) but that there is
something wrong with my system. Somehow the webcam driver
is not getting something that it needs. Supporting this is
another webcam ( 0c45:6009 Microdia VideoCAM ExpressII) that
I have been using for testing giving the same results as the
crystal eye which is puzzling to me:

  &gt;xawtv
sh-4.0# xawtv
        This is xawtv-3.95, running on Linux/i686 (2.6.29.2)
        xinerama 0: 1280x800+0+0
        /dev/video0 [v4l2]: no overlay support
        v4l-conf had some trouble, trying to continue anyway
        Warning: Cannot convert string
               &quot;-*-ledfixed-medium-r-*--39-*-*-*-c-*-*-*&quot; to type FontStruct
        ioctl: VIDIOC_G_STD(std=0xafcbe0d0a7d612b0
        [PAL_I,PAL_D,PAL_K,PAL_N,NTSC_M,
        SECAM_D,SECAM_G,SECAM_K,SECAM_L,?ATSC_8_VSB,ATSC_16_VSB,
        (null),(null),(null),(null),(null),(null),(null),(null),(null),(null),

        (null)]): Invalid argument
        ioctl: VIDIOC_S_STD(std=0x0 []): Invalid argument

and then on an attempt  to grab (ppm) (jpeg)

    (no cut and paste here because the webcam just died with :
        sh-4.0# xawtv
        This is xawtv-3.95, running on Linux/i686 (2.6.29.2)
        xinerama 0: 1280x800+0+0
        X Error of failed request:  XF86DGANoDirectVideoMode
        Major opcode of failed request:  136 (XFree86-DGA)
        Minor opcode of failed request:  1 (XF86DGAGetVideoLL)
        Serial number of failed request:  67
        Current serial number in output stream:  67
     )

why is the ioctl call failing and why does it keep telling me
     no way to get: 384x288 16 bit TrueColor (LE)
     no way to get: 2048x1572 24 bit TrueColor (BE: rgb)

I have a &quot;Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Pro 4000&quot; that uses
   the pwc.ko module and it works fine.

One issue could be that the ATI RS690M X1200 Series chip
doesn't have enough support. As of the  last time I wrote I
was looking for a source of  the problem and I notice to my
horror that  the XFree86 driver was &quot;vesa&quot;
 (from XFree86 -configure)
and that XFree didn't have any support whatsoever for the
video chip. There was one of those horrific proprietory
drivers that I tried to build but soon realized that even
Knuth would never get the thing built.  Fortunately Xorg has
good support for the chip so I rebuilt the x-system using
Xorg code.

Anyway any ideas as to how to proceed are appreciated.

Bruce
