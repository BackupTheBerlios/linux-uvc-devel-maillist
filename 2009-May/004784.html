<PRE>Hello Laurent

&gt;<i> &gt;    ioctl: VIDIOC_S_STD(std=0x0 []): Invalid argument
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    why is the ioctl call failing?
</I>&gt;<i> Because VIDIOC_S_STD isn't supported by webcam drivers (that ioctl only makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense for analog video). xawtv should be able to cope with that. You might
</I>&gt;<i> want to upgrade it.
</I>
I have xawtv-3.95 which is the latest stable release.

&gt;<i> &gt;      and why does it keep telling me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      no way to get: 384x288 16 bit TrueColor (LE)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      no way to get: 2048x1572 32 bit TrueColor (BE: rgb)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that related to the webcam or to the display ?
</I>
This I don't know. Xorg.0.log gives me

(==) RADEON(0): Depth 24, (==) framebuffer bpp 32
(II) RADEON(0): Pixel depth = 24 bits stored in 4 bytes (32 bpp pixmaps)
(==) RADEON(0): Default visual is TrueColor
(**) RADEON(0): Option &quot;DRI&quot;

so the message may be a side effect of something else especially if
it doesn't ring a bell for you. I think xawtv may not be working at all
since the webcam green light doesn't come on whereas with luvcview it
does. At this point I'm not going to bother with it.

&gt;<i> &gt;     Anyway any ideas as to how to proceed are appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> Use luvcview for testing. If luvcview doesn't work xawtv will not work either.
</I>
Okay. Here's what I have done to the code in luvcview, (luvcview-20070512)
since it looks like it might take a long time to get this going.

1) added -g to the CFLAGS to add debugging support for gdb if it ever
   gets to that level.
2) set static int debug = 1; in v4l2uvc.c to get whatever error
   messages it has.
3) For starts added a perror message at the beginning of every function
   call like below:

int check_videoIn(struct vdIn *vd, char *device)
{
int ret;
perror(&quot;START init_v4l2&quot;);

Later on if needed I could add some kind of switch to turn them on
and off. This has tracked down the a problem with terminating the
program. Currently only kill -9 will work. Have a look at the following
output notice the last entry:

 ... ... ...
 ... ... ...
START dec_rec2: Success
START idct: Success
START idct: Success
START idct: Success
START idct: Success
START idct: Success
START idct: Success
START yuv420pto422: Success
START dec_readmarker: Success
START eventThread: Success
START uvcGrab: Success
START video_enable: Success
uvcGrab: memset(&amp;vd-&gt;buf, 0, sizeof(struct v4l2_buffer));: Success
uvcGrab: vd-&gt;buf.type = V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE;));: Success
uvcGrab: vd-&gt;buf.memory = V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP;: Success
uvcGrab: ret=ioctl(vd-&gt;fd, VIDIOC_DQBUF, &amp;vd-&gt;buf); (BEFORE THE CALL): Success
uvcGrab: ret = ioctl(vd-&gt;fd, VIDIOC_DQBUF, &amp;vd-&gt;buf (AFTER THE CALL);: Success
uvcGrab just before  Capture a single raw frame: Success
V4L2_PIX_FMT_MJPEG: Success
START jpeg_decode: Success
bytes in used 77389
END uvcGrab normal: Success
START uvcGrab: Success
uvcGrab: memset(&amp;vd-&gt;buf, 0, sizeof(struct v4l2_buffer));: Success
uvcGrab: vd-&gt;buf.type = V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE;));: Success
uvcGrab: vd-&gt;buf.memory = V4L2_MEMORY_MMAP;: Success
uvcGrab: ret=ioctl(vd-&gt;fd, VIDIOC_DQBUF, &amp;vd-&gt;buf); (BEFORE THE CALL): Success
                                                     ^^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^^
The program does all its initializations printing out lots of stuff (which
I don't show here) and eventually arrives at uvcGrab (Which I assume is the
routine entered at the frame rate to get the camera data by whatever method).
The call is completed once, some other stuff is executed, it is entered
again, calls

    ret=ioctl(vd-&gt;fd, VIDIOC_DQBUF, &amp;vd-&gt;buf)

and never returns. (notice the message (BEFORE THE CALL). It stays
in the call until kill -9 luvcview(PID) is executed.

&quot;ps x&quot; gives:

2592 pts/3    Sl+    0:00 luvcview

indicating interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete) and
multi threaded. On question is why doesn't it time out?

I have another webcam (0c45:6009 Microdia VideoCAM ExpressII) that uses
&quot;modprobe sn9c102&quot; to work. If I run it with luvcview it is only gives
a green screen but the uvcGrab looping  works and it terminates normally.
I have another program (sn-webcam) where the ExpressII works okay.

By the way doing &quot;make&quot; on luvcview gives a lot of redefinitions like:

uvcvideo.h:31:1: warning: &quot;V4L2_CID_WHITE_BALANCE_TEMPERATURE&quot; redefined

I assume this is intentional. Anyway looking forward to you comments.

Bruce
