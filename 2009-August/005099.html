</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Great explanation - thanks!

What would the risks be in using method 1 but turning streaming on/off 
on a device that may support a min framerate of 30fps fast enough to 
grab say 1fps and thus conserve USB bus bandwidth?  Is there a rather 
long latency in being able to start/stop streaming from the current UVC 
devices?

How can I determine what the USB bus utilization is for a specific 
device that I'm testing?  I'm not quite clear if there is anything in 
/proc/bus/usb/devices that can be decrypted to provide this 
information.  I'm up for hacking in some printk's into usbcore if thats 
what it would take.

Thanks,

Tim
&gt;&gt;<i> If this is true then even if I only want to grab 1 frame per second from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each camera (to lower overall USB bandwidth) the bus would still need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support the full-framerate stream from each camera. Is this true?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if both the driver and the device supported still capture, the UVC 
</I>&gt;<i> specification doesn't clearly state that still image capture is supported 
</I>&gt;<i> while no video stream is active, so it's not clear how the camera would behave 
</I>&gt;<i> in such a case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is the streaming framerate a per-camera feature so that I can't necessarily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> count on any given UVC camera to allow me to stream only 1fps on the bus?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a camera feature, yes. You need to check the USB descriptors for the 
</I>&gt;<i> available frame rates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, the required bandwidth is also a per-camera feature. Some cameras 
</I>&gt;<i> will require a lower bandwidth when you lower the frame rate, some won't. This 
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the size of the camera frame buffer, which is usually quite small 
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe a few lines). The camera would need to be able to buffer a full frame 
</I>&gt;<i> to send low frame rates at lower bandwidths.
