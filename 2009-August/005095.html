As stated, all I can base my opinion on is the number of problem reports I've 
received. The VX-7000 is supposed to be UVC compatible but doesn't implement 
quite a few basic UVC requests (fortunately the driver works around the 
problem). I'm thus pretty sure it has never been tested with Linux during the 
development process, and I wouldn't be on its quality.

The picture quality is a completely different story, I have no information 
about that.

After some googling I also found out that the VX-6000 is not UVC compatible.

</I>
I'm pretty confident that Logitech has tested the camera with Linux.

&gt;<i> The cameras have marketing specs of &quot;video up to 1280x1024&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;frame rates up to 30 fps&quot;. I can of course accept that it's possible

</I>
Frame rates usually decrease with the resolution. The limiting factor is quite 
often not USB bandwidth (as MJPEG compression would allow to stream 
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/linux-uvc-devel">1280x1024 at 40fps</A> quite easily over a USB 2.0 link) but sensor capabilities. 
Without looking at the camera UVC descriptors I can't tell what frame rates it 
really supports at 1280x1024, but I don't expect more than 15fps (if not 
10fps).
