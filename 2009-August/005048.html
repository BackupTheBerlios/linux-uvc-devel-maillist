<PRE>Sir:
I'm so glad to hear that camera id (093a:2700) was supported by UVC.
But to my surprise, my camera name is not the one list on site
<A HREF="http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/">http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/</A> (iSonicW002). When I plugging my device
and trying camera application, it always return error message like &quot;No
available video device&quot;. It seems that my camera isn't recognised by
UVC driver yet. I opened it and found a chip name PAP7501.
I don't know what to do to make my camera work.
Messages below are copy from system. Hope it useful.
Thanks for your great work!
Thanks!
