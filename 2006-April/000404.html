No, I haven't contacted anyone else about it yet.  If I were to do it, I
would use a CMOS imager, because designing with a CCD sounds difficult
because of all the chips necessary, and the fact that I have no
experience doing it.

As far as I can tell there are only two suitable CMOS parts (I define
suitable as having a global shutter):

Micron MT9V022 (752x480), about $40
<A HREF="http://www.micron.com/products/imaging/products/MT9V022.html">http://www.micron.com/products/imaging/products/MT9V022.html</A>

Cypress IBIS5-A-1300 (1280x1024), about $250
(the URL is too long, just browse Cypress's website)

The price difference is startling, but they both look like decent, easy-
to-use chips.  They have a nice high-dynamic-range mode which would be
fun to play with.

Other than the imager, we'd need a USB 2.0 chip such as the Cypress
CY7C68013/14/15/16 series.  I'd do Firewire, except that requires more
than one chip and more design work.

Connecting the imager to the USB would be either an FPGA or a DSP like a
Blackfin.  The FPGA would be straightforward, but there would be only so
much extra computation it could handle.  A DSP would be more flexible
(for example to include motion tracking in firmware, downsampling, etc.)
but would be a bit more complicated and would require an SDRAM.

Anyway, just some ideas.  Anyone, feel free to chime in with
suggestions.
