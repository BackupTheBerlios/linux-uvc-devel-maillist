<PRE>&gt;<i> You say the driver is stable ? I'd so much like to say the same thing, but
</I>&gt;<i> I can't get any application to work. Would it be possible to hook up
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere a kind of 'HowTo' or 'step-by-step guide to making your camera
</I>&gt;<i> work a little bit' ? On the website maybe ?
</I>
Well, it's quite easy. If video acquisition doesn't work, the application is 
probably at fault. Frame rate and compression parameters can't currently be 
modified, but I'm working on that.

If you want to test the webcam, use luvcview which, despite its name, is not 
UVC specific.

&gt;<i> Maybe some steps are missing for my installation, but I can't get mplayer
</I>&gt;<i> to work, neither xawtv, or gstreamer. I want to record a video feed and
</I>&gt;<i> save it to disk, with audio in, that's all :) But for now, I can't manage
</I>&gt;<i> to do that!
</I>
mplayer assumes that every V4L2 drivers support the VIDIOC_S_STD ioctl. Can't 
someone get in touch with the mplayer developpers to fix that issue ?

Not sure what's wrong with xawtv, it doesn't work on my laptop for other 
reasons (related to the graphic card), but I think I've heard at least one 
success report with the linux-uvc driver.

As for gstreamer, what errors do you get ?

&gt;<i> Is the kernel 2.6.15 required ?
</I>
Linux 2.6.15 is not required by the driver itself, but it includes many USB 
2.0 fixes which make USB transfers much more reliable. This means you can use 
an older kernel, but data will be much more likely to be corrupted.

&gt;<i> Is patching every application required ?
</I>
Not all of them. Properly written applications don't need a patch :-)

&gt;<i> Would there be a way to bypass application patching, just for a tiny laps
</I>&gt;<i> of time, even with a patch labeled 'DANGEROUS-AND-NOT-RECOMMANDED' ?
</I>
Some such patches have been posted to the mailing list in the past, but they 
probably won't be included in the driver.

&gt;<i> thanks for all your great efforts :)
</I>
You're welcome :-)

Laurent Pinchart
