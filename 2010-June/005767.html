<PRE>Thanks for the answer. I'll try to add this changes by myself.

Right now, I can get the physical pfn of the user pointer. The first 
approach that came into my mind was to get a pointer to the page struct 
with the pfn_to_page(...) function.
You already added a new function called uvc_buffer_write which maps 
(kmap_atomic) the pfn associated with the page struct into the kernel 
space (basically the logical kernel address is returned). And then the 
data from the uvc cam is copied to the buffer and finally, the pfn is 
unmapped with kunmap_atomic.

So, I thought this should work. But, I'm getting a paging error:
&quot;Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address cdf46000&quot;

Could that paging error occur because the physical page resides outside 
of the physical memory that linux holds. That means I specified 216MB 
for Linux. The memory from 216MB to 256MB is reserved for the DSP. And 
the user pointer passed to the UVC driver points to 223MB which is above 
the memory of Linux.
So, maybe the MMU doesn't know that there are physical pages and has no 
mapping for it!?

Thanks,
Andreas
