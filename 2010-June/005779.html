<PRE>Hello

   Luvcview uses SDL if I remember well since a few months when I looked
into the sources. As I know there is no direct support or control in SDL
over which rendering engine is used behind the scenes. With XVideo you
normally get yuv formats and sometimes and for some video drivers/cards you
also get RGB. 

 

Mpeg2 is a compressed format that is decompressed most of the times into an
accelerated YUV format. YUV formats can be directly sent to the video card
using XVideo - if that's available.

 

You should look in your case what part: mpeg2 decompression or display takes
up the CPU time. 

 

Now on the other side if your card uses the vesa drivers to display to the
screen XVideo extension is never available for that driver. 

UVC does provide 2D accelerated formats (it mostly provides only those and
MJPEG) 

 

1)       Take a look into Xorg.0.log and check the video used driver.

2)       Check the times spent by the mpeg decompression task.

3)       xvinfo - should help you see if XVideo can be used at all and what
formats are available.

 

XVideo is just a way to pass let's say a video format encoded on (for
example) 2 bytes/pixels YUV instead of 4 (RGBA) - to the video card. The
video card then knows to display those video formats and knows how to scale
them as well (eating only GPU processing time and not CPU). Usually this
means passing just pointers to the video frame (as got from the video
capture device) to the video card for display.

Subject: [Linux-uvc-devel] XVideo support?

 

Hi,

 

    I am new to the UVC project. Currently I am working on video
conferencing on Linux and met some performance issues. I hope you experts
can help me to solve these.

 

    My target board is 

 

VIA CLE266 which onboard an VIA C3 1Ghz CPU. 

512MB DDR333 Dimm.

Logitech C100 webcam.

 

    480p mpeg2 video playback with mplayer and xvideo costs 20~30% of CPU
powers. 50~70% of CPU powers with 720p mpeg2 video file.

 

    However, when I execute luvcvideo, the console shows 

 

  Video driver: x11

  A window manager is available

 

    I was wondering that luvcview lacks XVideo support or UVCVideo doesn't
provide the video format that supports XVideo?

 

    Another problem is skype. In skype chat &amp; video window, it ate 100% of
CPU powers and A/V was out of sync. I didn't know which one is the
bottleneck in skype. That's why I asked for help here.

 

    I am new to the video processing in Linux, so some problems are
conceptual. Any information and wikis are welcome.

 

    Thanks for reading this mail.

 

Best regards,

Asho
