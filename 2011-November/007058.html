<PRE>It's quite safe to say no one has ever made a camera like this 
commercially. Even yuy2 is very rare, as the bandwidth requirements are 
too high. I've made custom built hardware that captures PAL to yuy2 uvc 
at 768 x 576 and that takes ~22MB/s on the USB bus, which only works on 
quite stable usb connections (ie most front ports can't keep up because 
of error rates). To even get 720p at 25fps you would need 35MB/s which 
is relatively rare to achive on a real device. You've got not chance of 
getting 1080p except at a very low frame rate.

On top of that, Windows UVC driver doesn't support NV12 as standard, so 
you would need to add your own directshow filter to convert it. This is 
what I do to support Y800 which isn't officially supported by uvc 
anyway, but by adding my own custom filter I can convert it into RGB24 
at the computer end and use it fine.

Manufacturers just use mjpeg typically, because it means they can get 
high resolutions, windows support and still work on a normal usb port 
easily.

If you really need NV12 you will basically need to make your own 
controller, I can suggest the LPC3131 because I know it works, but it 
takes a lot of work to make it, and you would need frame buffer memory 
added to it to handle NV12 (my hardware doesn't have any ram for 
framebuffering).
