<PRE>Hi Simon,

Thanks for the report.

&gt;<i> It works okay with skype, mplayer and with lucview. (I get some pixels

</I>&gt;<i> cheese bug or a driver bug.
</I>
Could be either, or both :-)

If other applications work correctly I would be tempted to say the bug is in 
Cheese (or possibly in any middleware it uses, such as gstreamer or libv4l). 
It could still be a driver bug (or worse, webcam bug) that is only triggered 
by the specific calls sequence Cheese happens to make.

Do you get any error message in the kernel log ?

&gt;<i> The device also has lights built around it, is it possible to turn them
</I>&gt;<i> on in linux?
</I>
It should, but it won't be straightforward. The UVC specification doesn't 
address lights, so the driver doesn't know about them.

Devices are allowed to extend the UVC specification to expose controls not 
present in the standard. This is done through extension units, and your device 
has one of them:

[snip]

&gt;<i>       VideoControl Interface Descriptor:
</I>&gt;<i>         bLength                28
</I>&gt;<i>         bDescriptorType        36
</I>&gt;<i>         bDescriptorSubtype      6 (EXTENSION_UNIT)
</I>&gt;<i>         bUnitID                 4
</I>&gt;<i>         guidExtensionCode         {5dc717a9-1941-da11-ae0e-000d56ac7b4c}
</I>&gt;<i>         bNumControl             8
</I>&gt;<i>         bNrPins                 1
</I>&gt;<i>         baSourceID( 0)          1
</I>&gt;<i>         bControlSize            3
</I>&gt;<i>         bmControls( 0)       0x59
</I>&gt;<i>         bmControls( 1)       0x80
</I>&gt;<i>         bmControls( 2)       0x80
</I>&gt;<i>         iExtension              0
</I>
The bmControls field is a bitmask that lists all supported controls. The 
values above mean that controls 0, 3, 4, 6, 15 and 23 are supported. 
Unfortunately no documentation is available to describe those controls. I'm 
pretty sure that one of them controls the lights. Guessing will be required.

WARNING: This could damage your device. Some vendors export firmware update 
controls, and accessing them incorrectly could erase the firmware.

You will first need to download and install the uvcdynctrl tool that comes 
with libwebcam (available through www.quickcamteam.net). Make sure you get the 
SVN version, last time I checked the tarball was outdated.

Then, you will need to create an XML file that describes mappings between the 
extension unit controls and V4L2 controls. To do so, take the Logitech sample 
XML file and adapt it to your extension unit. You can map all the available 
controls to V4L2 controls (pick some private value). The missing piece of 
information is the control selector: to access a control, the driver needs to 
pass a selector value to the device. For extension units selectors are usually 
equal to the control index in the bmControls bitmask plus 1, but that's not 
required by the spec. It's a safe first guess though.

The next step is to configure the uvcvideo driver with the extension unit 
controls information using uvcdynctrl and the XML file you've created. You 
will then be able to access the controls through the V4L2 API.
