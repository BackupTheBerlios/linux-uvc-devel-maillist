Oops. Yeah! Same here. Modern kernels apparently have it built in. No
there is no easy way to remove it when it's builtin. You'd have to
build your own kernel, but for this simple test it isn't worth the
trouble for you to do that...

So still we're convinced that while some cameras remove formats from
their list-of-supported-formats depending on the USB connection speed,
your camera is a bit weird and switches the list completely when on
a full-speed (usb-1.1, 12Mbps) connection. 

So, your application will have to handle the mjpeg stream. It's not
that difficult, but you'll have to link against libjpeg to decode
it. Whether Libjpeg can decode directly into yuv I don't know.

For testing/development purposes I suggest you find a camera that you
can connect to your PC that also supports mjpeg there.....

	Roger.

Q: It doesn't work. A: Look buddy, doesn't work is an ambiguous statement. 
Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific!
