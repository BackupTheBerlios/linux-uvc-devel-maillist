<PRE>I am having trouble getting the OmniVision webcam in the Dell SP2309W
monitor to work under Ubuntu 9.10. Others have reported that the video
works right out of the box but they have problems with the audio. I
don't know why my situation would be any different, but it is.

Bus 005 Device 006: ID 05a9:2649 OmniVision Technologies, Inc.

I'd like to include luvcview -L output here but it has scrolled away and
my attempts to correct the situation have left me unable to run it any
more. It said there was one supported format, MJPG, at various
resolutions and frame rate of variously 1/15 or 2/15. But even with -f
mjpg it would not work. However, we probably can't debug that until I
can fix my drivers.

How I messed up my system: I had source downloaded a couple of months
ago and built it

make release
make
make install

At this point a modprobe uvcvideo fails:

FATAL: Error inserting uvcvideo
(/lib/modules/2.6.31-21-generic/kernel/drivers/media/video/uvc/uvcvideo.ko):
Unknown symbol in module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)

dmesg says:

[165394.669479] uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol video_devdata
[165394.669486] uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_devdata
[165394.670453] uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol

[165394.670754] uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_device_alloc
[165394.671023] uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol
video_register_device
[165394.671026] uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_register_device
[165394.671754] uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol
video_device_release
[165394.671757] uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_device_release

Wanting to get back to my previous state:

make rminstall

and I put back the uvcvideo.ko which was present before I ever compiled
anything. But modprobe uvcvideo now fails with:

WARNING: Could not open
'/lib/modules/2.6.31-21-generic/kernel/drivers/media/video/v4l1-compat.ko':
No such file or directory
WARNING: Could not open
'/lib/modules/2.6.31-21-generic/kernel/drivers/media/video/videodev.ko':
No such file or directory

Apparently I did something wrong. How can I get back to some sane state?
