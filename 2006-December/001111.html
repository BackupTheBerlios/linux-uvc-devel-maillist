<PRE>Hi Viktor,

&gt;<i> I am considering to buy a webcam for a school project, where I need at
</I>&gt;<i> least 1024x768 (1280x1024 would be great) resolution at 2-3 fps. I
</I>&gt;<i> made a lot of search, but I don\'t want to buy anything, that will not work
</I>&gt;<i> under linux. I have found these candidates:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i>  Hercules DualPix HD
</I>
The product home page doesn't mention anything about UVC. The drivers are not 
available for download, so there's no way to get more information without 
trying the webcam or asking the vendor.

&gt;<i>  Creative Live! Cam Voice  (1280 X 960)
</I>
The &quot;driver&quot; doesn't include any .inf or .sys file. This might mean that the 
webcam is supported by a generic Windows driver, such a the UVC driver or 
image class driver.

&gt;<i>  MS LifeCam vx-6000 ( even 1600x1190 )
</I>&gt;<i>  Trust  Megapixel USB2 Wide Angle Webcam Live WB-6200p ( 1280 x 1024 )
</I>&gt;<i>  Genius Look 1320  ( 1024x768 )
</I>
Those webcams use a SN9C201 or SN9C202 chipset with one or two dozens various 
possible sensors. I don't know of any Linux driver supporting those chipsets 
today. Michel Xhaard might be working on it, but don't expect support anytime 
soon.

&gt;<i> Is there chance to get them working ? (I could also help, if somebody
</I>&gt;<i> could point me the right way, I don\'t have experience in making
</I>&gt;<i> drivers, but have some programming skills)
</I>
Getting the SN9C20x-based webcams working is not impossible, but will require 
a great deal of work.

&gt;<i> Or could somebody recommend me a cam, that works reliable under Linux ? (I
</I>&gt;<i> have looked at Logitech's page, but they claim, they do only 640x480 video
</I>&gt;<i> even if they have a 1.3MP sensor)
</I>
Have a look at <A HREF="http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/">http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/</A> for a list of known supported 
devices. Please note that Logitech webcams have a hardware bug which makes 
the camera difficult to use. Some people experience the bug (the webcam stops 
responding) and some don't. There is currently no way to work around it, and 
no way if your computer will be affected.

Merry Christmas,

Laurent Pinchart
