<PRE>Hi,

It's a bit more subtle than that. The bug is a timing issue, and thus the 
camera doesn't work reliably (or at all) for some people depending on their 
particular hardware (CPU speed, USB controller, ...). But you're right, those 
cameras are somehow broken.

&gt;<i> So, my question is, whose of these cameras listed are really known to work

</I>
This is hard to tell. Most cameras work fine until someone finds a problem. 
From my experience (so this isn't an authoritative answer) the Creative and 
Sonix webcams work, as do the latest Logitech ones (Quickcam Pro 9000 and 
Quickcam Pro for Notebook 2007 (PID 0990 and 0991).

&gt;<i> I need a camera with low latency, sharp image and support for exposure
</I>&gt;<i> settings.
</I>
That's another problem then. Most webcams (at least the ones listed on the 
website) use a CMOS sensor. You won't get sharp pictures under low light 
condition. Depending on your needs, you might want to go for a CCD sensor 
instead. Those will be found in more expensive industrial cameras.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart.
