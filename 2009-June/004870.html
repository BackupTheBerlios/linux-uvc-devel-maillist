<PRE>Hi Bruce,

</I>
I've learnt with time that all kinds of weird behaviours are possible. Vendors 
tend to be very imaginative when it comes to implementing bugs :-)

&gt;<i> I spent a couple of days documenting the lsusb listing and everything points
</I>&gt;<i> to it being UVC-compliant. Now what I would really like to know is if I'm
</I>&gt;<i> right about the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   If there is a stream of mjpeg payloads coming in, whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> we can sync them, we still should be able to detect things like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             M_SOF0, M_SOI, M_EOI ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in the stream, yet  when I scan the packets I get messages like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 lapsystemx kernel: uvcvideo: doing scan
</I>&gt;<i>                 lapsystemx last message repeated 4360 times
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;scan&quot; just searches any packet greater than the header size
</I>&gt;<i> (typically 12) and if it finds 0xff it prints out the preceding
</I>&gt;<i> and following byte. (in case there is some endianess lurking about)
</I>&gt;<i> I can't believe that 4360 payloads come in whithout any jpeg
</I>&gt;<i> information at all. If this is the case what are these packets?
</I>
Good question. Could you dump them ? You could give usbmon a try to dump USB 
traffic.

&gt;<i> Are there other quick tests that I could try in case the device is saying
</I>&gt;<i> that it is putting out mjpeg packets but is really putting out another
</I>&gt;<i> format?
</I>
If the device outputs YUYV instead of MJPEG we'll really need a way to 
synchronize on frame boundaries. I'm not sure it's worth it trying to analyze 
the data format before getting proper synchronization information.

&gt;<i> The other thing I am wondering is what is the format of the *.raw files that
</I>&gt;<i> luvcview creates. Are they more or less jpeg files (assuming this particular
</I>&gt;<i> case of a webcam doing mjepg streaming)
</I>
I suppose they're just raw frames of data as received from the driver without 
any header.

&gt;<i> If I toggle the video-&gt;last_fid every time a packet comes in it gives me a
</I>&gt;<i> convenient way of sending this data to user-land and luvcview then can write
</I>&gt;<i> the *.raw files which I can the examine so currently information on these
</I>&gt;<i> files is helpful.
</I>
Be careful that the &quot;frame&quot; rate could get quite high, and luvcview could then 
loose frames.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
