<PRE>Hi Laurent, Hi Simon,

... I'm the poor guy who has the 064e:a101 Suyin cam troubles :-) 

&gt;<i> I'm the maintainer of linphone (video chat tool), and I use uvcvideo driver
</I>&gt;<i> without major problems every day,
</I>It'd be interessting which device and on what distribution you have.

&gt;<i>I doubt this is a bug in your code. In this context -EPROTO is a low-level USB 
</I>&gt;<i>error generated by the USB stack. It usually indicates faulty devices or 
</I>&gt;<i>cables. What webcams do your complaining users use ?
</I>I have an Acer Travelmate 5720 with the camera built in. So loose USB
cables aren't an option :-) USB works fine with my scanner, my Philips
cam, sticks, whatever. It might be worth noticing that the camera is
internally connected to the USB.

Besides of that camera does work on Linux! I can grab images directly
with ffmpeg and everything is well. 

And I might swear that I've seen the cam working on Linux and Linphone
on my Notebook. But as I have had sound woes as well, I reinstalled,
upgraded... and now the images are gone (and the sound partially works)
but I can't reproduce when this happened.

I meanwhile reinstalled the Windows version of Linphone (after having
Windows Vista totally off for a while and reinstalled) - and it does not
work eiher. Linphone-wx crashes when video is on. Other Windows camera
programs do work though.

My suspicion in this case: Something does not set some initial values in
the driver correctly. ffmpeg does - linphone (or whatever it uses to
grab the images from the cam) doesn't. No idea where this happens- in
the app or in the driver...

It could well be a different video mode (did I hear somewhere that the
cam is YUV only? - whatever this means for linphone) - probably the only
one of the many modes that causes troubles.

Anyway - I hope my information does help

Thank you for your efforts in advance.

Greetings
Conrad
