Logitech developed its own driver for Windows, mostly because the Microsoft 
one is so buggy it's near to unusable. As far as I know, they have no 
specific driver for MacOSX.

</I>
The webcam works fine with Windows. I worked with Logitech to locate the 
differences between the drivers, and we found out the problem wasn't 
driver-related only. The Linux and Windows USB stacks are quite different, 
which results in different timings on the USB bus. Linux is faster, and the 
webcam isn't able to cope.

With this in mind, we tried to add delays in the Linux UVC driver. This didn't 
work, as the timing issues were not only related to inter-request delays but 
to intra-request delays as well (USB control requests are made of several 
packets handled by the USB EHCI controller without any mean for a device 
driver to influence on packets processing). Fixing the problem would mean 
reworking to Linux USB stack completely and making it slower. Even if that's 
something we wanted, it wouldn't be a simple task.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
