<PRE>Hello,
&gt;<i> * You do not need to completely decode the JPEG pictures! I'm certain there
</I>&gt;<i> is a very good correlation between sharp details in the picture, and the
</I>&gt;<i> presence of high-frequency coefficients in the JPEG data. Basically,
</I>&gt;<i> frequency analysis of the picture has already been done for you for free by
</I>&gt;<i> the MJPEG compression!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>That is also what i would like to understand, decoding a picture just
&quot;half-way&quot;. I am interested in finding a motion detection algorithm,
that does not take much ressources like CPU and RAM. What i would like
to get, is the average color of each JPG-block (should be in there) and
if to many blocks change from frame to frame, i would assume it is a
motion. Do you have any hints for that? Currently i would assume i have
to implement JPG decoding myself in order to understand the algorithm
and stop at the right decoding level.
&gt;<i> * Most of the time while the camera is in use, there will be no need to
</I>&gt;<i> adjust the focus. The adjustment algorithm should only kick in when there
</I>&gt;<i> are significant changes (movement) in the centre of the image. A cheap
</I>&gt;<i> check for larger-scale changes is possible by looking at the JPEG DC
</I>&gt;<i> coefficients, which specify the mean brightness of each 8x8 square of the
</I>&gt;<i> picture. As long as there is no movement, this check need not even be done
</I>&gt;<i> for every frame, but maybe only every .5 sec or so.
</I>Exactly, i would assume that this algorithm allows embedded devices to
do the motion detection well enough.

Kind regards,
Tom
