</I>LTSP is Linux Terminal Server Project.  Basically it allows you to run
low-power, diskless workstations (also called thin clients) completely
over the network.  The thin clients retrieve a basic operating system
from the LTSP server, then establish a remote session (graphical or
otherwise) to the LTSP server or to any other server you specify.

The key here is that there is no embedded operating system on these thin
clients.  They use PXE or Etherboot to get their operating system from
the LTSP server.

The thin clients run a local X server (downloaded from the LTSP server),
and then all applications run on the LTSP server.  A 200 MHz thin client
with 64 MB of RAM is capable of running modern software very quickly.
Well, really it's only displaying the software -- it's actually running
on the server.

Anyway, this causes some complications when plugging local devices into
the thin client, because the server needs access to these devices.
Local usb storage works.  Local sound works.  But I haven't come across
anyone using local webcams.  When I tried it, it didn't work, but I
didn't try for very long.  I have to borrow the webcam to do my testing,
and I have limited time to do my testing.

So the problem can be attacked in a few ways.  All of these depend on
getting the proper modules to load when the camera device is plugged in,
which I think I can handle.

1) Run the video application (luvcview, for instance) locally on the
thin client.  LTSP calls this &quot;local applications&quot; and I'd consult the
LTSP list for instructions on doing that.

2) Run the video application on the server (the normal way LTSP works),
but convince the video application to access a video device over the
network.

3) Have LTSP treat the local webcam the same way a local USB drive or a
local sound card is treated.  Unfortunately I don't know the specifics
of that, so I was hoping to hear from somebody &quot;sure I've done that
before, it's easy!&quot;

Thanks for any advice you guys might have.

By the way, I'm trying to use the ProScope HR camera at the 9 thin
clients that are installed in my company's machine shop.  The cameras
are to be used for inspection of some very small parts.  This camera
does work on Linux using the uvc driver.
