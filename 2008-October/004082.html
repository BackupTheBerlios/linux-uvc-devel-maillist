<PRE>I'm new to the list, and to webcams in general.  My company wants to
purchase a few ProScope HR cameras (supported by the uvc driver) to use
for inspection of parts.  The camera works fine with luvcview, but does
not work properly with either Cheese or Camorama.  Personally, I like
luvcview, but I'd like to give the users a choice.

Is there something special that needs to be installed in order to use
Cheese and Camorama with the uvc driver, or are they just incompatible?
 Camorama claims that it cannot find /dev/video0 (which does exist).
Cheese runs but does not produce any video and the program takes a few
minutes to close.

I'm running Debian Lenny and using packaged software.  Nothing is
compiled from source.

Thanks for your help.

-Rob
