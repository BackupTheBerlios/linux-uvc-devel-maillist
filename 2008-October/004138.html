</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Could you describe the problem with more details ? A quick summary of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hardware/software setup would probably be interesting too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LTSP is Linux Terminal Server Project.  Basically it allows you to run
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> low-power, diskless workstations (also called thin clients) completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over the network.  The thin clients retrieve a basic operating system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from the LTSP server, then establish a remote session (graphical or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> otherwise) to the LTSP server or to any other server you specify.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The key here is that there is no embedded operating system on these thin
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clients.  They use PXE or Etherboot to get their operating system from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the LTSP server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The thin clients run a local X server (downloaded from the LTSP server),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then all applications run on the LTSP server.  A 200 MHz thin client
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with 64 MB of RAM is capable of running modern software very quickly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, really it's only displaying the software -- it's actually running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the server.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, this causes some complications when plugging local devices into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the thin client, because the server needs access to these devices.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Local usb storage works.  Local sound works.  But I haven't come across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone using local webcams.  When I tried it, it didn't work, but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> didn't try for very long.  I have to borrow the webcam to do my testing,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I have limited time to do my testing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know how local USB storage is handled ? Obviously, as the USB storage 
</I>&gt;<i> device is plugged into the thin client, the thin client operating system 
</I>&gt;<i> (both kernel space and userspace) must support the device and 
</I>&gt;<i> somehow &quot;export&quot; it through the network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see two ways this can work for USB storage devices. Either the thin client 
</I>&gt;<i> acts as a USB-Ethernet bridge (USB/IP), with the server handling the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> USB mass storage protocol, or the thin client mounts the device locally and 
</I>&gt;<i> exports it through the network (NFS, CIFS, ...).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I researched this a bit.  USB local storage is handled by what they call
ltspfs.  It seems to be a good solution for files, but probably not for
devices.

In case you're interested, here is a description:
<A HREF="http://www.ltsp.org/twiki/bin/view/Ltsp/LtspFS#Introduction">http://www.ltsp.org/twiki/bin/view/Ltsp/LtspFS#Introduction</A>

&gt;<i> In the first case the same system might be used for webcams, although the 
</I>&gt;<i> latency and bandwidth requirements are quite different.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the problem can be attacked in a few ways.  All of these depend on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> getting the proper modules to load when the camera device is plugged in,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which I think I can handle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Run the video application (luvcview, for instance) locally on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thin client.  LTSP calls this &quot;local applications&quot; and I'd consult the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LTSP list for instructions on doing that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's probably the easiest path for you, although it might be a bit heavy on 
</I>&gt;<i> the thin client resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This is what I'm researching now, because I agree, it does seem like the
easiest path right now.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Run the video application on the server (the normal way LTSP works),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but convince the video application to access a video device over the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> network.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You will need a server process on the thin client to forward the video stream 
</I>&gt;<i> to the server-side application, which will then re-forward them to the thin 
</I>&gt;<i> client's display. The CPU and memory constraints incurred by the Linux UVC 
</I>&gt;<i> driver would still have to be handled by the thin client as in option 1, but 
</I>&gt;<i> you will save the application's memory and CPU footprint. In case of simple 
</I>&gt;<i> applications such as luvcview I think this will actually be slower than 
</I>&gt;<i> option 1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Have LTSP treat the local webcam the same way a local USB drive or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> local sound card is treated.  Unfortunately I don't know the specifics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of that, so I was hoping to hear from somebody &quot;sure I've done that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before, it's easy!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you ssh into the LTSP box ? If so you can easily check if USB mass storage 
</I>&gt;<i> devices are locally mounted or exported through the network using USB/IP.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That's possible to do, but I'm not set up for it yet.  Still learning...

I'll report back when I've made some progress.
