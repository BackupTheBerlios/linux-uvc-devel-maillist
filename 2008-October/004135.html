<PRE>Hi Juho,

</I>
It would be much easier for me to maintain the driver in a kernel git tree, 
but then we would loose all backward compatibility. Let's not go that far 
yet :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; However, I expect most people to be interested in the latest version

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I imagine that most people who will download the uvcvideo sources
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly from the repository will, now that the driver has been included
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the kernel, just want to try the latest version to get a patch specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to their issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, that's probably the case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How many developers checkout a non-head SVN revision or use SVN log or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; diff commands on the Linux UVC SVN repository ? I'd really like to have

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't really referring to the log or even diff commands per se.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather keeping oneself up to date with the latest repository without
</I>&gt;<i> redownloading it.
</I>
Good point. It's definitely easier to svn up than to download a new tarball 
and look at the diff output.

&gt;<i> &gt; Very good point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MajorFeatures">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MajorFeatures</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; states that Mercurial uses &quot;Bandwidth and CPU efficient HTTP and SSH sync
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protocols&quot; so I guess this won't be an issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, according to that it seems to be a non-issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hence my question above about usage of SVN log and diff commands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (commit is not an issue as I'm currently the only committer). Do you feel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that tarballs are unpractical for the majority of users who just want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; try the latest version ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not committing, but sometimes syncing and diffing to check if
</I>&gt;<i> there's a workaround for the old camera issue my camera had. :p
</I>
Feel free to report the issue if it's still present in the latest version :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; You only need a single tarball, the one containing the tree you want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checkout (in our case this would be the linux-uvc tree). People
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complained in the past about the lack of tarball and the required use of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SVN so I thought everybody would be happy with tarballs, but it seems this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not the case :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I understood you also need to get the v4l/dvb core sources and
</I>&gt;<i> maybe some other modules to compile it, would they be in the same
</I>&gt;<i> tarball or how are they got?
</I>
They would be in the same tree, thus in the same tarball. make &amp;&amp; make install 
(or a small variation thereof) should install everything 
in /lib/modules/`uname -r`.

&gt;<i> Don't take my opinion as the general opinion though, I'm just personally
</I>&gt;<i> happier with svn compared to tarballs but most people probably aren't. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd stick to SVN too if it wasn't for the #ifdef's :-/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that's good enough reason, as I said if that's the thing to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid ugly code then should just go for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; download a tarball. This in itself lowers the barrier. They will also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to compile and install the v4l core modules in addition to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uvcvideo module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That could raise the barrier, but don't forget that there should be more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community support as compiling and installing a linuxtv.org tree is an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operation performed by more users than compiling and installing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uvcvideo driver. In a quick chat on the #v4l IRC channel I got told v4l
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers do
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's just that the first time I checked out and compiled uvcvideo I
</I>&gt;<i> was slightly amazed at how easy and painless everything went. That
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like it will go from amazing to a slight pain in the ass in the
</I>&gt;<i> future, but that should be acceptable.
</I>
The v4l tree compilation and installation procedure seems quite 
straightforward. You can either build and install all modules (make &amp;&amp; make 
install) or configure the ones you need (make menuconfig). It shouldn't get 
more difficult than that.

&gt;<i> I'm mainly replying because you asked for comments, in the end it's your
</I>&gt;<i> call since you do the commits. :) 
</I>
And I'm glad you replied, otherwise the amount of comments would have been 
divided by two.

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
