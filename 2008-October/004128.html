<PRE>Hi everybody,

I've been working on code refactoring to make the UVC driver more robust when 
used with non-compliant UVC devices (we all know there are many of them). 
Before you rejoice, this has nothing to do with the Logitech firmware bug. 
Sorry.

Anyway, the attached patch (against SVN head) modifies video control handling 
to handle failed GET_MIN/GET_MAX/GET_DEF requests more gracefully. Failed 
requests will now generate a one-time warning message instead of the 
usual &quot;Failed to query...&quot; error, which should be more user-friendly. The 
driver will also recover automatically from failed GET_MIN/GET_MAX requests 
when the device is half-broken without requiring the MINMAX quirk (fully 
broken devices still need the quirk).

The patch is required to implement JPEG quality control which I will soon work 
on. As it's quite intrusive, I'd like to make sure it doesn't break anything. 
I'd appreciate if you could test it, especially if you got one of the 
following cameras:

ALi M5606 (Clevo M540SR)	(0402:5606)
Creative Live! Optia		(041e:4057)
Microsoft Lifecam NX-6000	(045e:00f8)
Microsoft Lifecam VX-7000	(045e:0723)
Apple Built-In iSight		(05ac:8501)
Silicon Motion SM371		(090c:b371)
Acer OEM Webcam			(5986:0100)
Packard Bell OEM Webcam		(5986:0101)
Acer Crystal Eye webcam		(5986:0102)
Compaq Presario B1200		(5986:0104)
Acer Travelmate 7720		(5986:0105)
Medion Akoya Mini E1210		(5986:0141)
Acer OrbiCam			(5986:0200)
Fujitsu Amilo SI2636		(5986:0202)
Advent 4211			(5986:0203)
???				(5986:0300)
Clevo M570TU			(5986:0303)

Testing the patch means making sure the webcam is still detected properly by 
the driver (it should be as I haven't changed anything there) and is still 
able to stream video (use any software you like, pick one that you know is 
working).

Of course nothing should break, but bugs happen. That's not completely true, 
as I don't have enough information about the two Microsoft cameras to make 
sure they will still work. I'm thus especially interesting in hearing from 
you if you got a supported Microsoft webcam.

Cameras in the above list should print a few extra messages in the kernel log 
when starting a video stream. Please include them in your report.

Enough said, I wish you all happy testing :-)

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
