<PRE>Hi Lauren,

In fact I would prefer git as well, but if hosting is mercurial only
then... :)

</I>
Hmm, that's probably the case.

&gt;<i> How many developers checkout a non-head SVN revision or use SVN log or
</I>diff
&gt;<i> commands on the Linux UVC SVN repository ? I'd really like to have
</I>statistics
&gt;<i> on such usage.
</I>
I wasn't really referring to the log or even diff commands per se.
Rather keeping oneself up to date with the latest repository without
redownloading it.

&gt;<i> Very good point.
</I><A HREF="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MajorFeatures">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MajorFeatures</A>
&gt;<i> states that Mercurial uses &quot;Bandwidth and CPU efficient HTTP and SSH sync
</I>&gt;<i> protocols&quot; so I guess this won't be an issue.
</I>
Yeah, according to that it seems to be a non-issue.

&gt;<i> Hence my question above about usage of SVN log and diff commands
</I>(commit is
&gt;<i> not an issue as I'm currently the only committer). Do you feel that
</I>tarballs
&gt;<i> are unpractical for the majority of users who just want to try the latest
</I>&gt;<i> version ?
</I>
I'm not committing, but sometimes syncing and diffing to check if
there's a workaround for the old camera issue my camera had. :p

&gt;<i> You only need a single tarball, the one containing the tree you want to
</I>&gt;<i> checkout (in our case this would be the linux-uvc tree). People
</I>complained in
&gt;<i> the past about the lack of tarball and the required use of SVN so I
</I>thought
&gt;<i> everybody would be happy with tarballs, but it seems this is not the
</I>case :-)

But I understood you also need to get the v4l/dvb core sources and
maybe some other modules to compile it, would they be in the same
tarball or how are they got? Don't take my opinion as the general
opinion though, I'm just personally happier with svn compared to
tarballs but most people probably aren't. :)

&gt;<i> I'd stick to SVN too if it wasn't for the #ifdef's :-/
</I>
I guess that's good enough reason, as I said if that's the thing to
avoid ugly code then should just go for it.

&gt;<i> download a tarball. This in itself lowers the barrier. They will also
</I>have to
&gt;<i> compile and install the v4l core modules in addition to the uvcvideo
</I>module.
&gt;<i> That could raise the barrier, but don't forget that there should be more
</I>&gt;<i> community support as compiling and installing a linuxtv.org tree is an
</I>&gt;<i> operation performed by more users than compiling and installing the
</I>uvcvideo
&gt;<i> driver. In a quick chat on the #v4l IRC channel I got told v4l
</I>developers do

It's just that the first time I checked out and compiled uvcvideo I
was slightly amazed at how easy and painless everything went. That
sounds like it will go from amazing to a slight pain in the ass in the
future, but that should be acceptable. I'm mainly replying because you
asked for comments, in the end it's your call since you do the commits. :)


Regards,

Juho
