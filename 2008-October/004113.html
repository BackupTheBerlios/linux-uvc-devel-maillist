No problem.

</I>
Thanks, that's very clear.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would expect the number of SVN checkouts to have dropped over the last
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3 monts, but Berlios doesn't provide such statistics. I'm thus asking
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your opinion : should I switch the Linux UVC driver to a Mercurial tree ?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Pros:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  - The driver will be hosted along most other video-related kernel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> projects - An important part of the compatibility code (uvc_compat.h and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> various #ifdef's around the source) can be dropped, as the source tree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contains the latest v4l core source.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That answers my questions above, I think? I think that would be a con
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for those of use who backport to older kernels.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Backporting will still work, but you will have to backport the v4l/dvb core as 
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
Sure.

&gt;<i> Do you really mean backporting (thus on kernels older than 2.6.15, as the 
</I>&gt;<i> uvcvideo driver supports 2.6.15+ kernels already), or were you referring to 
</I>&gt;<i> using the driver with a 2.6.15+ kernel ? In the later case the switch to 
</I>&gt;<i> Mercurial would drop compatibility with 2.6.15 but 2.6.16 and above should 
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>
Unfortunately, yes. One of the embedded platforms I develop for is based
around 2.6.10.

&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What's your opinion ? Is someone strongly opposed to the switch ? If so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> please state your reasons. All constructive opinions are welcome.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess I would be opposed for teh reson above, but I'm probably a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small minority!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your opinion in nonetheless important.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maintaining backward compatibility in the uvcvideo driver itself wasn't that 
</I>&gt;<i> much of a burden until now, but changes in the v4l core queued for 2.6.28 
</I>&gt;<i> would introduced a whole new set of #ifdef's all around the driver. The code 
</I>&gt;<i> would become messy and I'd like to avoid that if possible. Hence the idea of 
</I>&gt;<i> switching to Mercurial.
</I>
I can see that you would wish to avoid that.

Cheers

Darren
