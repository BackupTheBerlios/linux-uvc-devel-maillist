</I>I'll add to the cons installing and learning yet another version control
system. Also I remember that with some projects they require some new
version of mercurial which is not found from any distribution (in that
case there was no snapshots available), so even looking at the latest
code was a serious pain in the ass (excuse me my expression) and
required compiling the whole version control system from source. I hope
nothing even resembling that experience will come out of the switch.

Also since I'm in China there's all kinds of blocks and connectivity
problems, can the mercurial repository be checked out over http like the
SVN can? If your only connectivity to the outside world is a proxy, HTTP
is very handy. If not, that is a con as well, the tarballs help with it
a bit but you don't REALLY want to do real work by always downloading a
new tarball. linux-tv.org that you mentioned seems to be owned by some
domain hijackers, so I guess you mean linuxtv.org? If I click the
&quot;CVS/Mercurial&quot; link on their page I get an empty page. :) Not so
convincing, but at &quot;Repositories&quot; link I can get links to tarballs.
There's no easy way to get all required tarballs and nothing else, I
really wouldn't list the tarballs as a pro since you have to get many of
them...

So generally I'm opposed to the change, but if that's the only way to
avoid ugly ifdefs around the code then I guess have to say go for it.
Personally judging by that email, I feel that the barrier to download
and compile uvcvideo will be much higher than before, maybe even over
the limit of doing it on your own. That's just my 5 euro cents (around
0.47 CNY with current rate).
