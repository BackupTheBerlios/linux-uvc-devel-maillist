<PRE>Hi Forrest,

first of all, sorry for the late reply.

No worries. You did well.

Here's an answer I got from Logitech after forwarding your issue (kudos to 
them for providing great technical support) :

&quot;It sounds like the user is scripting multiple launches of uvccapture, i.e.
a &quot;start stream, take snapshot, stop stream&quot; sequence every 5 seconds. In
that case the camera probably does not always have time to adapt the
exposure time properly when the stream starts. In general it's not a good
idea to restart the stream so often because of the time it takes for the
algorithm to settle. I would suggest using uvccapture -t, in that case it
shouldn't happen.&quot;

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
