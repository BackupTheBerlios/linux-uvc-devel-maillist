<PRE>Hi everybody,

now that the driver has been integrated into the mainline kernel for 3 months, 
and shipped by most distributions, I'm considering dropping the uvcvideo SVN 
repository on Berlios and create a Mercurial tree on linux-tv.org where most 
other video-related kernel projects are developed.

linux-tv.org Mercurial trees contain a copy of the whole v4l/dvb subsystem. 
The main implication would be that, to use the latest uvcvideo driver instead 
of the one shipped with your kernel, you will have to install the v4l core 
module from the Mercurial tree along with the uvcvideo module, instead of the 
uvcvideo module only as you do now.

I would expect the number of SVN checkouts to have dropped over the last 3 
monts, but Berlios doesn't provide such statistics. I'm thus asking your 
opinion : should I switch the Linux UVC driver to a Mercurial tree ?

Pros:
 - The driver will be hosted along most other video-related kernel projects
 - An important part of the compatibility code (uvc_compat.h and various 
#ifdef's around the source) can be dropped, as the source tree contains the 
latest v4l core source.
 - A tarball of the tree sources can be downloaded from the linux-tv.org web 
interface, freeing people from installing and using a version control 
software they might not be used to (Mercurial/SVN).
 - One less repository means more consistency.

Cons:
 - Installing the uvcvideo driver from the source tree will require 
installation of the v4l core module as well (and possibly other v4l/dvb 
modules you require for the hardware you own and use).

What's your opinion ? Is someone strongly opposed to the switch ? If so please 
state your reasons. All constructive opinions are welcome.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
