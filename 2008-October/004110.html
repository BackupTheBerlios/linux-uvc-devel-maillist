<PRE>Hi,

The driver now supports most of the UVC specification, except

- stream-based payloads
- still image capture
- timestamps in video streaming

The first two features, especially stream-based payloads, would not be too 
difficult to implement, but I lack hardware for testing. I don't know of any 
UVC-compatible device supporting stream-based payloads or still image 
capture.

Timestamps in video streaming is an important feature supported by all devices 
that is currently unimplemented. It doesn't require an in-depth knowledge of 
the Linux kernel of the UVC specification, but the algorithm behind the 
function is not trivial.

Basically, 3 clocks are involved with UVC devices. The device clock (a crystal 
local to the device), the USB clock (shared between the device and the host) 
and the host clock (local to the host). With each video payload devices send 
two timestamps, one relative to the local device clock and one related to the 
USB clock. The goal is to used that information to synchronise the device 
clock with the host clock and produce a timestamp relative to the host that 
can be reported to userspace. Definitely not trivial to implement.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
