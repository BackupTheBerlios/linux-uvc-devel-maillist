<PRE>Hi Laurent,

Thanks for your reply.

Excerpts from Laurent Pinchart's message of 2011-07-31 18:28:27 +0200:
&gt;<i> Those values are 2500 / 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2 and 1. There's unfortunately no 
</I>&gt;<i> way for the driver to know that other values will lead to bad results. I've 
</I>&gt;<i> seen bad firmware bugs, but this one is high on the list.
</I>Hm, ok. Maybe we could add a quirk for the specific models? But that won&#8217;t help
us with the 'step' value, because it&#8217;s not flexible enough for 2500/x, right?

&gt;<i> That's weird. I'm wondering if the camera doesn't just reset all controls when 
</I>&gt;<i> the video stream is started. What happens in the second case if you stop the 
</I>&gt;<i> video stream and restart it ? Are exposure settings correct, or do they go 
</I>&gt;<i> back to bad values ?
</I>When I stop the video stream and restart it, I can see about half a second of
the 'Exposure, Auto' == 3 capture, then it switches to my settings (without
auto exposure). If you want me too, I can make a video of this.

&gt;<i> Probably in the camera firmware. The device queries the camera for default and 
</I>&gt;<i> current values, and I wouldn't be surprised if the camera reported a default 
</I>&gt;<i> value that it doesn't use as a default.
</I>So, I guess a quirk would be the way to go in this case? Are you interested in
patches for this issue?

&gt;<i> How do you mean ? On non-broken cameras you can just set the control to any 
</I>&gt;<i> legal value and things will work :-)
</I>Yes, but I expect to just plug in my camera and start a video chat in Pidgin.
Where do you usually configure your exposure settings? I mean, you don&#8217;t do it
by hand every time you plug in your camera, right?

Best regards,
Michael
