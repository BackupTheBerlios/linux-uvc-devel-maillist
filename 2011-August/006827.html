<PRE>Hi Robert,

thank you for your response, even if it sound a bit like zombie
commercial :)

I took a look on the specification and feel like i need to put two bits
of doubt concerning this webcam, just in case some one wont to by it.

reference to:
<A HREF="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/for-business/products/webcams-headsets/devices/b990-hd-webcam">http://www.logitech.com/en-us/for-business/products/webcams-headsets/devices/b990-hd-webcam</A>
- Native 5MP HD sensor
- High-definition video in 720p widescreen mode with recommended system
- Color depth: 24-bit true color
- Frame rate: Up to 30 frames per second streaming video in 720p and VGA
mode

Doubts:
- 24-bit true color - i'm confused here, seems like we can access only
16-bit color over yuv. will it really do 24bit with h264? Even if it
will cost more power?... i think it is not true
- Even if it has 5MPixel sensor, seems like we have access only to 1MP.
According to this <A HREF="http://pastebin.com/9WFgytwY">http://pastebin.com/9WFgytwY</A>
the biggest resolution what it provide is 1280x720, in other words
&quot;High-definition video in 720p&quot;. This is also maximal resolution what
can be uncompressed provided with ~15fps over USB2.0 . But it give us
actually only 10 fps.
JPEG compressed stream seems to be more realistic, it can indeed do 30
fps at HD720p. I guess it will take about 30Mbit/S bandwidth.

Now after it sounds more realistic...

H264 can reduce it even more (no doubt). In case of hardware encoder, we
should be able to dynamically control encoding process, reduce keyframe
frequency and be able to force KF if needed to recover the stream, (i
guess you currently trying to find it out). And if you use gstreamer
then, thelepythy+gstreamer should be able to control it as well.

It looks like lots of work and fun. Suddenly i do not have this toy to
play with it. I hope it is really worth it.

Regards,
	Alexey.
