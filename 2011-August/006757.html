You could still set step to 1, and fixup the value in the driver.

&gt;<i> &gt; That's weird. I'm wondering if the camera doesn't just reset all controls

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stop the video stream and restart it ? Are exposure settings correct, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do they go back to bad values ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I stop the video stream and restart it, I can see about half a second
</I>&gt;<i> of the 'Exposure, Auto' == 3 capture, then it switches to my settings
</I>&gt;<i> (without auto exposure). If you want me too, I can make a video of this.
</I>
Some firmware developers should be banned from using a computer forever...

&gt;<i> &gt; Probably in the camera firmware. The device queries the camera for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; default and current values, and I wouldn't be surprised if the camera
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reported a default value that it doesn't use as a default.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I guess a quirk would be the way to go in this case? Are you interested
</I>&gt;<i> in patches for this issue?
</I>
A quirk could fix the manual exposure control values issue, but it won't fix 
the other problem(s) you got with that device.

&gt;<i> &gt; How do you mean ? On non-broken cameras you can just set the control to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any legal value and things will work :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but I expect to just plug in my camera and start a video chat in
</I>&gt;<i> Pidgin. Where do you usually configure your exposure settings? I mean, you
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t do it by hand every time you plug in your camera, right?
</I>
To be honest I don't use webcams for video conferencing much :-) When I do I 
just leave the default control values, that works pretty well on the webcams I 
use.

Maybe libv4l could help there. There has been some discussions about adding 
control save/restore features to the library. I don't know if that has been 
implemented.
