</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  The idea is as fallow, use jpeg bits for error corection. According to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  brocken.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  I got fallowing result (N - mean header is ok, but no data is present;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  As you can see, my webcam try to resent SOI lots of times and only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  last try is correct. For next example i added logic to send ENODATA on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  each packet with correct header but no data. Here is the result:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Your camera sounds weirder than mine!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  One potential issue to make sure of if you want to throw away packets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  with valid headers but no data: my camera (Quanta integrated webcam:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  0408:2fb1, sends EOF (usually) in an empty packet - I think you want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  make sure that this is looked for before discarding the packet. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  maybe what happens with your filter - I didn't look closely enough to see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  My camera actually works more or less perfectly now with the patch I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  sent in earlier. My camera has several distinct problems:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  1) In YUV mode the camera sometimes gives up on a frame part way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  through, when this happens it doesn't give an EOF, but toggles FID. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  released driver checks the length of YUV frames if the frame is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  terminated with EOF but it doesn't if the frame is terminated with FID.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  So I check that uncompressed frames terminated with FID are the correct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  length. This is something that should probably be added globally.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  2) In MJPG mode the camera sometimes toggles FID one or two packets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  early. Fortunately EOF is reliable in MJPG, so in MJPG I ignore FID
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  fully (based on a patch you supplied).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Sadly I need EOF for MJPG and need FID in YUV...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  3) Sometimes payload packets get broken in chunks that are 1/3 or 2/3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  their proper size. This is bad - since the later chunks don't have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  headers, and left uncorrected the raw image data gets interpreted by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  driver as header - and all sorts of random things happen. It turns out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  to be not so difficult to reassemble these packets though, just based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  lengths.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll send you one more patch to visualize some info from header, may be we 
</I>&gt;<i> can filter some thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  4) The camera sometimes doesn't start. This turns out to be a problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  people have seen in windows too. Somebody finally figured out a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  work-around - if the camera doesn't start, you can just point it at a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  light and then it starts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  The very strange thing about all of this is that none of these issues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  appear to be universal. Many people have complained of #4, but other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  linux users do not appear to have problems 1, 2, or 3.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  5) The camera lies about the frame rates it can do in high resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  YUV. It says it can do 30fps at 1600x1200 (and 1280x720 and 1024x768)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  yuv - but that's way more bits than USB 2 can carry. I don't think this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  causes any real problems though - you just don't get the frame rate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  advertised.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Carl
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can do size check for yuv, but nothing for jpeg. Jpeg stream has really 
</I>&gt;<i> good chance to be more error proof, since jpeg has markers on the start and 
</I>&gt;<i> end of image. The idea is to use this jpeg markers instead of FID or EOF. In 
</I>&gt;<i> my patch this markers are not used, but displayed. SOI and EOI are jpeg 
</I>&gt;<i> marker for start and end of image.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since your webcam is so brocken, it is a good test case :) Can you please 
</I>&gt;<i> send me dmesg with output from my patch by capturing jpeg stream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

The length check I mention is for yuv: but the current driver only does 
that length check when it sees EOF - it doesn't do it if the frame is 
terminated by FID - so I added that check.

I can try your patch (not now - dont have that computer here) but without 
the reconstruction I already do I can't imagine it helping - because 
without the reconstruction, the driver chops off some of the mjpg or yuv 
data interpreting it as header.  Each time that happens, 12 bytes get 
chopped out of the middle of the frame, and random bits get interpreted as 
FID, EOF, ERROR etc...

My guess is that if I apply your checks with my stream reconstruction 
it will find that every frame is fine.  Without my stream reconstruction, 
there will still be corrupt frames because some image data will be 
interpreted as header. Just searching for SOI and EOI won't help because 
they will generally be there in the right place, but a few bytes from the 
middle of the stream get removed (and misinterpreted).

Its true what you propose might help with one of my problems: the fact 
that FID is sometimes toggled a packet or two early in MJPG.  But for me 
that doesn't matter since EOF is reliable.
