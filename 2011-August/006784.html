</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your camera sounds weirder than mine!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One potential issue to make sure of if you want to throw away packets

</I>&gt;<i> 0408:2fb1, sends EOF (usually) in an empty packet - I think you want to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that this is looked for before discarding the packet. This
</I>&gt;<i> maybe what happens with your filter - I didn't look closely enough to see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My camera actually works more or less perfectly now with the patch I
</I>&gt;<i> sent in earlier. My camera has several distinct problems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) In YUV mode the camera sometimes gives up on a frame part way
</I>&gt;<i> through, when this happens it doesn't give an EOF, but toggles FID. The
</I>&gt;<i> released driver checks the length of YUV frames if the frame is
</I>&gt;<i> terminated with EOF but it doesn't if the frame is terminated with FID.
</I>&gt;<i> So I check that uncompressed frames terminated with FID are the correct
</I>&gt;<i> length. This is something that should probably be added globally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) In MJPG mode the camera sometimes toggles FID one or two packets
</I>&gt;<i> early. Fortunately EOF is reliable in MJPG, so in MJPG I ignore FID
</I>&gt;<i> fully (based on a patch you supplied).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly I need EOF for MJPG and need FID in YUV...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Sometimes payload packets get broken in chunks that are 1/3 or 2/3
</I>&gt;<i> their proper size. This is bad - since the later chunks don't have
</I>&gt;<i> headers, and left uncorrected the raw image data gets interpreted by the
</I>&gt;<i> driver as header - and all sorts of random things happen. It turns out
</I>&gt;<i> to be not so difficult to reassemble these packets though, just based on
</I>&gt;<i> lengths.
</I>
I'll send you one more patch to visualize some info from header, may be 
we can filter some thing.

&gt;<i> 4) The camera sometimes doesn't start. This turns out to be a problem
</I>&gt;<i> people have seen in windows too. Somebody finally figured out a
</I>&gt;<i> work-around - if the camera doesn't start, you can just point it at a
</I>&gt;<i> light and then it starts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The very strange thing about all of this is that none of these issues
</I>&gt;<i> appear to be universal. Many people have complained of #4, but other
</I>&gt;<i> linux users do not appear to have problems 1, 2, or 3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) The camera lies about the frame rates it can do in high resolution
</I>&gt;<i> YUV. It says it can do 30fps at 1600x1200 (and 1280x720 and 1024x768)
</I>&gt;<i> yuv - but that's way more bits than USB 2 can carry. I don't think this
</I>&gt;<i> causes any real problems though - you just don't get the frame rate
</I>&gt;<i> advertised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Carl
</I>
We can do size check for yuv, but nothing for jpeg. Jpeg stream has 
really good chance to be more error proof, since jpeg has markers on the 
start and end of image. The idea is to use this jpeg markers instead of 
FID or EOF. In my patch this markers are not used, but displayed. SOI 
and EOI are jpeg marker for start and end of image.

Since your webcam is so brocken, it is a good test case :) Can you 
please send me dmesg with output from my patch by capturing jpeg stream.
