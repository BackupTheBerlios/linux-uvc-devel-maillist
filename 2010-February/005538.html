<PRE>Perhaps a patch like the one attached?

It implements a quirk for my specific camera. All other cameras are left alone...unless someone sets the quirks module parameter.

Hey Laurent,

Would you accept a patch for a quirk that adjusts the timestamp for the latency caused by urb_submit(). The adjustment would be done by counting ISO packets. The quirk would be disabled by default. It's a hack but it would do what I need. The URB completion routine runs every 125us - 4 ms depending on the size of the video frame. At 4 ms it limits the resolution of v4l2_buffer.buf.timestamp to 250 Hz. With the proposed patch, the resolution would always be 8 kHz.

I think skew/jitter is a little out of scope for what I am trying to accomplish. I am trying to establish the time at which the photo was taken with as much accuracy as possible. I'm tracking a fast moving target in 3 dimensional space using two webcams. For this, 4 ms accuracy is not enough but 125 microseconds is. The cameras run independent clocks so I need to correlate them to a common clock. At the moment my best option is to correlate it to the PC system time. My application isn't susceptible to clock skew/jitter. It doesn't buffer any data and can accept video whenever it becomes available. 

Thoughts?
Jake

That's correct.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Camera 0xe9ea5000 seems to be running off a different time reference from
</I>&gt;<i> camera 0xe9ea2000. If the cameras did echo the USB SOF into the SCR they
</I>&gt;<i> should track with urb-&gt;start_frame.
</I>
Just for the sake of correctness, the start_frame field isn't the SOF counter. 
It seems to wrap around at 8192, so I guess it's a micro-frame count for high-
speed transfers.

&gt;<i> As far as I can tell there is no way to correlate the SCR SOF counter to
</I>&gt;<i> the USB SOF. It looks like there is no way to (generically) determine the
</I>&gt;<i> device latency...
</I>
The SCR SOF and USB SOF *are* correlated. They run at the same speed and 
differ by a fixed (but non-deterministic) value.

The PTS/SCR relationship can be computed using the PTS/SCR fields in video 
data headers. The SCR/SOF relationship is known (except for the constant 
difference), and the SOF/host clock relationship can be computed using the SOF 
counter and the system time. With all those information, the PTS timestamp 
associated with the image can be converted to a system time, eliminating clock 
drift between the camera and system clocks. That's what the PTS/SCR fields are 
for.

&gt;<i> I can't tell when a device will use it's own counter or when it'll echo the
</I>&gt;<i> USB SOF frame number.
