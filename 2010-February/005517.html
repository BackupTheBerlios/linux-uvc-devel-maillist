<PRE>Howdy, all

So, it turns out that the new camera in the Lenovo Thinkpad T410 is 
(mostly) supported by the uvcvideo driver.  The USB id is 17ef:480f.  I 
copied the stanza from 17ef:480b (another Lenovo-branded camera) in 
uvc_driver.c and it Just Worked... well... mostly.

After a quick recompile (I'm running 2.6.33-rc6 with uvcvideo as a 
module), it's been pretty straightforward to get JPEG out of the webcam, 
but that &quot;M&quot; is still a challenge &#8212; I only seem to get a single frame 
each time I start a recording.  I've tried with  a bunch of different 
luvcview params, as well as with an ffmpeg incantation I found on the 
antiquated OpenFacts UVC page.

I also noticed that using guvcview, I can consistently get a frame out 
every time I change the resolution, even going up to 1600x1200. 
Furthermore, I get that frame regardless of whether I'm in MJPEG or YUYV 
mode.  But I still never get two frames. I found a historical post ([1]) 
describing the exact same problem I'm running into, but unfortunately it 
looks like the solution was &quot;this was fixed in subversion&quot;, not any 
actual hints.

I've attached the output of `lsusb -v -s 1:4` as root, in case it helps 
give some insight.  Any help getting the camera to display more than one 
frame at a time would be appreciated.

Cheers,
--xsdg
