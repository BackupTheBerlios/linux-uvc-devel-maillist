<PRE>Hi,

today I decided to get a webcam and got the above mentioned error with
two different uvc-supported models (Logitech C270, MS HD 5000).

I have a HP dc5850 microtower, it has an AMD Phenom II with AMD780
chipset (Radeon 3100 integrated graphics). I am running Debian testing,
kernel 3.1. Each time I plugged the Logitech C270 into the system, two
other USB devices (Samsung Printer, DLink wireless) stopped working. I
only got the other devices working again through a reboot, simple
unloading/reloading of the modules wouldn't help. Most of the times also
the USB mouse (MS Wireless 5000) would quit (the keyboard is PS/2). I
installed the webcam successfully on Windows 7, but when booting into
Linux the USB devices stopped working.

I returned the Logitech and got a Microsoft HD-5000 webcam instead. I
installed it in Windows 7 and rebooted to Linux. I was able to make a
test call with Skype on Linux and see my test image there, but when I
quit Skype the USB devices stopped working, and rebooting with the
webcam attached didn't help, i had to reboot again without the webcam.

There is a similar problem described here, but without a solution:
<A HREF="http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/25/22">http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/4/25/22</A>

Looking at the logs I suspect this might be some kind of interaction
between my wireless adapter (D-Link DWL-G122, Ralink RT73-based) and the
webcams, maybe involving the EHCI platform? Is there somebody else I
should tell about this?

I am attaching parts of my kern.log. If you need more info, I am glad to
give it...

Cheers

Michael
