</I>This type of thing happens. Just on a loosely related note, PC World in 
UK sold throughout 2006 and 2007 a line of 3-4 laptops and several 
desktops computers branded as Philips. It turns out that the desktops 
were made by an Irish company called iQon and the laptops were actually 
rebranded Twinhead models. I've worked on several of these laptops and 
they weren't of bad quality actually. The really frustrating thing was 
that Philips offered zero support (although they were sold under their 
name), and the same went for the actual hardware manufacturers. The 
support was left to a subsidiary/partner company of PC World called &quot;The 
Tech Guys&quot;, and it was dreadful. The laptops specially had absolutely no 
hint of the real manufacturer anywhere on them. For the laptop I was 
working on - &quot;The Tech Guys&quot; even posted the wrong motherboard chipset 
drivers. It took me 16 hours of research in all to realise that the 
drivers were wrong and it wasn't me doing anything wrong, and to finally 
discover that Twinhead were selling in Australia an identical laptop 
under their own name. After that it was all plain sailing.
