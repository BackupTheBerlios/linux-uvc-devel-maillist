<PRE>Hi Gilles,

</I>&gt;<i> values, and provide a menu for controls that require one. Let me know if my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding is flawed somewhere in here.
</I>
Your understanding is correct. An application should be able to create a 
usable GUI from information retrieved from the driver. Now, if the application 
wants to make the GUI more userfriendly, or deal with some rare corner cases, 
I expected some controls will have to be handled in a non-generic way. This 
should remain an exception though.

&gt;<i> The V4L2 spec lists the Pan Reset and Tilt Reset as Booleans, which is
</I>&gt;<i> already a bit better than Integer (what uvcvideo does so far),
</I>
For the sake of correctness, the controls are reported as integers by the 
uvcvideo driver because they have been configured as such by the userspace 
uvcdynctrl utility based on the information provided by the logitech.xml 
configuration file.

&gt;<i> although I stick to my comment in my previous post: I really think these
</I>&gt;<i> should be reported as Buttons for the obvious reason that resetting the pan
</I>&gt;<i> or tilt is a one-shot action, not a continuous one which holds a value over
</I>&gt;<i> time (this fits the definition of V4L2_CTRLTYPE_BUTTON in the specs). Using
</I>&gt;<i> a button type makes it clear that trying to get its value is pointless, and
</I>&gt;<i> it also makes sense when drawing this control on a GUI. I will bring this
</I>&gt;<i> up on the V4L mailing list but I thought I d throw this one here first and
</I>&gt;<i> see what people think.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> The V4L2 spec says the step value &quot;gives the smallest change of an integer
</I>&gt;<i> control actually affecting hardware&quot;. Calling ioctl(VIDIOC_G_CTRL) on the
</I>&gt;<i> Pan or Tilt Relative control with a value of 1, as per reported step value,
</I>&gt;<i> does not do anything. Both guvcview and luvcview get around that by
</I>&gt;<i> defining a macro set to 64. Do applications really have to guess/do that,
</I>&gt;<i> or can the driver simply report 64 as a step value ?
</I>
As stated in my previous mail, the camera itself reports erroneous values :-/

&gt;<i> The Pan/Tilt Reset control is a bit of a tricky one, because it is  a
</I>&gt;<i> collection of buttons (Pan reset, Tilt reset or both). Since we already
</I>&gt;<i> have dedicated controls for both Pan Reset and Tilt Reset, is it a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea change this one to &quot;Pan &amp; Tilt Reset&quot; only, so it can be presented as
</I>&gt;<i> a button ? If not, can this control have a menu explaining the different
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable values ?
</I>
The control should in my opinion be removed completely.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
