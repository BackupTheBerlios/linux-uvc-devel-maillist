<PRE>Hi all,

I am having a few problems with both a Quickcam Pro 9000 and a Creative
Live Optia AF camera on an embedded platform. Before I start digging
into the cause of the problems I thought I have better move to the
latest version of the UVC driver.

The version of the driver that I have working was the last revision in
the old SVN repository. With this version I simply modified the makefile
to point to my Kernel directory and specified my tool chain on the
command line with a CROSS_COMPILE=.... parameter.

With the latest version of UVC that I checked out of mercurial today,
the build process has become much more involved the build environment
does not seem to have any built in support for cross compilers unless I
am missing something. 

In order to cross compile the UVC module I modified the root makefile to
add a definition of CROSS_COMPILE and then changed the targets to:

install:
        $(MAKE) -C $(BUILD_DIR) CROSS_COMPILE=$(CROSS_COMPILE) install
%::
        $(MAKE) -C $(BUILD_DIR) CROSS_COMPILE=$(CROSS_COMPILE)
$(MAKECMDGOALS)

In the v4l/Makefile I changed the SRCDIR and the OUTDIR to point to my
kernel source tree. Everything seems to build ok, but when I try and
insert the module on my target I get an error from insmod:

	insmod: cannot insert './uvcvideo.ko': unknown symbol in module

dmesg shows the following:

uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol video_devdata
uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_devdata
uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol video_unregister_device
uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_unregister_device
uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol video_device_alloc
uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_device_alloc
uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol video_register_device
uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_register_device
uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol video_usercopy
uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_usercopy
uvcvideo: disagrees about version of symbol video_device_release
uvcvideo: Unknown symbol video_device_release

I gather that this shows some sort of missmatch between the environment
that the module was built for and the environment on the target board.
Is that correct? Are these issues related to these messages that I get
when the modules are built?:

Building the old code against the same kernel results in a module that
installs correctly, so I guess I have misconfigured something, but I am
not sure what! Any suggestions would be greatfully received.

Thanks

Jonathan
