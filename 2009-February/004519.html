Yep, I suspected something like that ...

Thank you :)

I can check this if I manage to get a sniffer to work. I will report
back once that far.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>

Hard to say which one is correct. It could be even both - Windows
accepts the value (doesn't report error) and the driver does some kind
of black magic afterwards to get things actually working.

I am getting different resolutions offered on Windows than on Linux and
also the camera seems to run at a lower framerate if both cameras are
streaming. I didn't try to measure it, but the stereo output looks like
~10fps or so. It could be a software issue as well, though.

The documentation is also cautioning to plug the device ideally to a
separate host and not to use the USB connectors on the front panel -
they assume that those are not full-featured. So it could be indeed a
marginal design.

&gt;<i> It would be helpful if you could capture all USB control traffic from device 
</I>&gt;<i> enumeration to video streaming using a USB analyser (a software one will do). 
</I>&gt;<i> It would show what bandwidth the device requests, and what bandwidth the 
</I>&gt;<i> Windows UVC driver selects.
</I>
As I said above, I will try to get a sniffer working and will report
back once that far.

Regards (and thanks),

Jan
