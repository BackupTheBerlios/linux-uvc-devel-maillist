<PRE>Hi Paulo,
I had a look at guvcview. I think it s a great app, full of features beyond
a simple frame view/capturing. Great work.
I am trying to write an application that properly displays V4L controls from
any driver, and I have tested with pwc and uvcvideo so far. Digging into
guvcview's source code confirmed what the point I made in my previous post:
img_controls.c, which draws controls on the screen, is full of if..else if
statements which do a lot more than just checking the control type. There
are also some hardcoded menu values for the raw pixel order. This is
precisely what I think should be done differently:
In my opinion, when enumerating V4L controls, user applications should NOT
have to check what a control DOES, ie trying to make sense of either the
v4l2_queryctrl.name or v4l2_queryctrl.id field (which is what guvcview
does), in order to draw this control on the screen. Doing this ties your
application to a specific driver/implementation/version/... and will require
more coding when any of these changes. An application should only have to
check what TYPE the control is (v4l2_queryctrl.type field, and possibly
enumerate over the different menu values if it is a menu), to decide how to
best draw it in a GUI. The driver shoud be responsible for filling in the
struct v4l2_queryctrl correctly with meaningful &amp; sensible values, and
provide a menu for controls that require one. Let me know if my
understanding is flawed somewhere in here.

The V4L2 spec lists the Pan Reset and Tilt Reset as Booleans, which is
already a bit better than Integer (what uvcvideo does so far), although I
stick to my comment in my previous post: I really think these should be
reported as Buttons for the obvious reason that resetting the pan or tilt is
a one-shot action, not a continuous one which holds a value over time (this
fits the definition of V4L2_CTRLTYPE_BUTTON in the specs). Using a button
type makes it clear that trying to get its value is pointless, and it also
makes sense when drawing this control on a GUI. I will bring this up on the
V4L mailing list but I thought I d throw this one here first and see what
people think.
The V4L2 spec says the step value &quot;gives the smallest change of an integer
control actually affecting hardware&quot;. Calling ioctl(VIDIOC_G_CTRL) on the
Pan or Tilt Relative control with a value of 1, as per reported step value,
does not do anything. Both guvcview and luvcview get around that by defining
a macro set to 64. Do applications really have to guess/do that, or can the
driver simply report 64 as a step value ?
The Pan/Tilt Reset control is a bit of a tricky one, because it is  a
collection of buttons (Pan reset, Tilt reset or both). Since we already have
dedicated controls for both Pan Reset and Tilt Reset, is it a good idea
change this one to &quot;Pan &amp; Tilt Reset&quot; only, so it can be presented as a
button ? If not, can this control have a menu explaining the different
acceptable values ?

Cheers,
Gilles

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have checked out the latest v4l code from the mercurial repository on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; linuxtv.org, and successfully compiled and loaded the uvcvideo module,
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tested with a logitech quickcam sphere af (046d:0994). I have comments
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions regarding the V4L2 controls to pilot the pan and tilt motors:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After mapping the dynamic controls (with uvcdynctrl), the following
</I>&gt;<i> controls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become available:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Pan Reset: min: 0, max: 1, step: 1, type: integer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Tilt Reset: min 0, max: 1, step: 0, type: integer (note the step value
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0 which should really be 1 here)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Pan (Relative): min: 4480, max: 4480, step: 1, type: integer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Tilt (Relative): min: 1920, max: 1920, step: 1, type: integer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Pan/tilt Reset: min: 0, max: 3, step: 1, type: integer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Creating a user interface based on these controls is quite hard because
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their types and step values:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to set a value of 0 on any of the Reset controls fails, even
</I>&gt;<i> though 0
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is reported as an acceptable value.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Setting a value of 1 on either Pan (Relative) or Tilt (Relative) succeeds
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but results in no movement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Keeping the GUI up-to-date is not possible because calling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ioctl(VIDIOC_G_CTRL) on any of these controls fails (which makes sense
</I>&gt;<i> when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you know what the controls are). But from a programming point of view, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you try to create an interface that will work with any controls, the way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these are reported (integers) makes it almost impossible to keep track
</I>&gt;<i> of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a couple of suggestions to improve this, and would appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comments on them:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Reporting the Pan/Tilt Reset control as a menu and Pan Reset and Tilt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Reset as buttons instead of integers, will solve the previously mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Change the Pan (Relative) and Tilt (relative) step value to one that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually results in a slight movement of the camera.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a way to make these changes when mapping the controls, or do
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to be coded in the driver itself ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Gilles
