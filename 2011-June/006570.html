<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Low frame rate problems have been seen with at least 5 UVC cameras on 
multiple computers.   It isn't low light, USB bandwidth, etc.   In the 
past, I have assumed the cameras were being dishonest about their 
performance, now I am pretty sure it is the UVC driver's fault.   On a 
newer, faster, computer performance has even gone down on some cameras.

I just got a new Logitech C910 UVC webcam.   This camera has a 5MP 
(2592x1944) sensor and can do 1920x1080/30P, 720x1280/30P, and 
640x480/60P.  It works right out of the box with guvcview except for:
   - The crippling frame rate problems described here
   - uvcvideo doesn't support still picture capture (this is a real 5MP
     bayer resolution webcam).
   - Exposure mode can be set to Manual or Aperature Priority.  Auto or
     Shutter priority produce an error.
   - Video in MJPG mode is badly corrupted when recording (any program) or 
when
     displayed in some programs.
Other than that, auto/manual exposure, digital zoom, digital pan/tilt 
(zoom first), auto/manual focus, etc. seem to work.   Sound not tested. 
It does support still image.
However, streaming to disk or using a number of other applications fails 
badly:
Tests were done on this camera, except where otherwise noted.

As we will see below, mplayer is the only one that admits to dropping 3/4 
of the video frames at 60fps but the other programs (or the driver) are 
doing it.



Because of the large number of video modes, less interesting modes have 
been deleted and only 480P, 720P, 1080P, and full sensor resolution shown 
in YUYV and MJPG:

guvcview gets max 12-14fps in any video mode down to 160x120.
Yes, I am using MJPG not YUYV.   No the camera exposure should not be 
knocking down the frame rate as this occurs even when pointed at a light. 
No the CPU isn't overloaded; Phenom II 1060T X6 and none of the cores are 
heavily loaded.   No, I am not plugged into a 12Mbps port.  No, the USB 
bus isn't loaded (unplugged another webcam). luvcview does a little 
better, getting 30fps at 160x120.    But if you run guvcview as root, now 
all of a sudden it can run 30fps up to 1920x1080.   This continues when 
you switch back to a normal user.    Until it breaks.   Which happened 
when I tried to read full sensor resolution.   After that, I was stuck at 
&lt;=15fps in all modes as root and ordinary user.   Removing both copies of 
.guvcviewrc didn't help.    Unpluging the camera doesn't fix it. 
Unplugging the camera and rmmoding uvcvideo (which takes videodev with it) 
and replugging the camera didn't fix it.   Plugging into USB 3.0 
superspeed port didn't help (not that the camera supports superspeed, just 
trying to change the USB controller).  &quot;shutdown -h now&quot; didn't fix it. 
Sound is disabled.

At one point during the brief time that it was working as root, I got 
58fps 640x480 and it did not slow down even when I lowered frame rate to 
30fps.   Don't know if it actually had anything to do with being root. 
It did work just long enough to indicate that the camera can deliver on 
its promised specifications.

It does appear guvcview frame rate display is somewhat unreliable.   I get 
different results if I turn it off and on, and they vary depending on how 
long it was off, like the title bar only gets updated once.   But on 
different cameras that do slow the frame rate in low light, the title bar 
fps is updated when I cover the lens.    The changing numbers when turning 
off/on the title bar fps readout may reflect resetting the boxcar 
averaging.  The low numbers do seem to reflect reality.  When I record 
files using various programs, I only get 25fps according to ffprobe.


Bad video looks like typically less than half of frame (varies how much 
frame to frame) with some errors of 1/4 to 1/2 width of frame in the 
section that is displayed.   Like there is a race condition between 
grabbing the video and playback or one of the errors encountered is bad 
enough to kill the rest of the frame.   I have played back with &quot;mplayer 
-vo x11&quot; to disable any hardware accelleration on my video card and the 
results are the same.


- Cheese - works but very limited
- guvcview record video - you get less than half a video frame and other 
errors.
- ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -s 640x480 -r 60 -vcodec mjpeg -i /dev/video0 -r 
60 -vcodec copy /tmp/test1.mjpeg
   You get the same unusable video as guvcview
   These errors reported before recording starts, then none during 
recording.

The bad vlc lines originate from libavcodec/mjpegdec.c

--sout=file/ogg:/tmp/test3.mjp
   vlc v4l2:///dev/video0:width=640:height=480:fps=60:chroma=MJPG
   you get the same unusable video (&lt;1/2frame) whether you are playing or 
recording.   No errors reported on record.  When simply watching cam, 
looks like this:
[0x9ebdb0] signals interface error: signal 17 overriden (0x7f41629c9450)

    vlc does display the image ok if you use YUYV instead of MJPG but then 
you are severly limited in resolution/frame rate.

more frames dropped.



- luvcview -s 640x480 -r 60 -f MJPG &amp;

   prints &quot;find DRI&quot; repeatedly
   reports 14, 16, and 20fps on subsequent runs when camera set to 60.
   title bar updated at least twice as it initially reports 0.0 fps.

  luvcview -s 640x480 -r 60 -f MJPG -C -o /tmp/test4.avi &amp;
  xine, mplayer, and vlc are unable to read the file.

Using read method instead of mmap doesn't seem to make a difference, tried 
with various programs.

Same problem on netbook running ubuntu 9.04.

It may be a bug where uvcvideo gives you the next frame received after you 
request a frame instead of giving you the next frame stored in the queue.

lsusb -v -d 046d:0821 is 1770 lines, so I won't include it.   The guvcview

posted the lsusb output here for same model camera:

Wireshark:

used YUYV since it is hard to infer info about number of frames from

This indicates less than 30 frames actually making it onto the wire in 
this mode or data is being lost within frames.

smaller packets (40-159 bytes).

Oddly, the highest MaxBit rate on this camera is 995328000 which exceeds 
the capacity of USB High Speed.   That is for 1920*1080 30fps MJPEG and is 
actually the uncompressed bitrate.  The bitrate for that resolution 
FRAME_UNCOMPRESSED is given as 165888000 which is for 2fps.   Most of the 
tests were done at 640x480 compressed or uncompressed and adequate 
bandwidth should be available.

Sometimes I get a little more than 15fps, for no apparent reason.  For 
example, now guvcview reports 18.00fps at 640x480/30P-MJPG and when I tell 
guvcview to capture video, it gives 24.18fps:
