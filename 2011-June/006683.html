</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it seems like I am much better off by fully disabling FID (with your

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) corrupt frames - with part of the image missing or the image

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) sometimes the camera just won't start.  when guvcview (or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> luvcview) is started, no frames come back from the camera.  There is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a light next to the camera that comes on to indicate it should be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> active, but no frames arrive.  There seems to be a fairly strong
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> correlation with using luvcview (which from the traces seems to use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> some different mechanism to get frames from the driver from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> guvcview.  guvcview polls, luvcview doesn't).  Sometimes just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> restarting guvcview several times will work and the camera
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> eventually starts.  Sometimes just changing resolution or frame

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reproducible.  I do not think this is related to your patch, as it

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   unavailable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and the trace shows guvcview polling, but nothing else going on.

</I>

I've made a fair bit of progress on this in the past few days - and 
actually have something that &quot;works.&quot;  It turns out there are at least a 
couple of distinct issues, and some that may be related.

The camera attempts to do both FID and EOF correctly.  It sends an
empty packet with EOF set in the header at the end of every 
completed frame.

The issues are:

1) in MJPG format, it frequently gets confused about exactly where FID
should toggle.  It often toggles in the right place, but not
infrequently toggles either one or two packets early (either in the
empty EOF packet, or in the variable length packet before that one).
There does seem to be exactly one toggle per frame though.  Here, FID
needs to either be completely ignored, as Alexey's first patch does, or 
the stream needs to be repaired.

2) in YUV format, the data coming in makes it look like the camera gives
up on some frames part way through, doesn't send an EOF packet, but simply
toggles FID to indicate that a new frame has started. This seems to happen
only in the highest resolution modes (1024x768 - very rarely, 1280x720,
1280x1024 and 1600x1200) - coincidentally (?) these are the modes where
the camera blatantly lies about its capabilites.  It claims to support
only one frame rate (30fps) for each of these resolutions.  But this is 
impossible - 1600x1200 at 30 fps is way more data than USB 2 can handle.

3) In either format, packets are sometimes delivered fragmented into
chunks of 1/3 or 2/3 of what the should be.  Looking at the usb video
class spec figure 2-13, it does appear that sometimes those three pieces
of the payload are delivered separately.

So, I have changes that:
a) ignore FID (completely) when in MJPG, but pay attention to it in YUV.
b) include a check for the length of the frame when uncompressed and the
frame is ended by an FID toggle (this was already in there, but only when
the frame was ended by an EOF).
c) reassemble packets that are delivered in chunks

the now camera works - all resolutions in both MJPG and YUV work, no bad
frames are delivered by the driver.  There are very infrequent frames
dropped due to the urb-&gt;status showing an error.  The biggest outstanding
issue is that in the four high resolution modes in YUV output, the frames
the camera gives up on occasionally cause noticeable stutters.  It is
intermittent though - it will be fine for 5 minutes, maybe dropping one
frame here, one there, and then it will drop several in rapid succession.

It looks to me like the issue with the faulty FID in MJPG output is a
camera bug.  I'm wondering though if the fragmented packets are due to
some timing/scheduling issue in the usb layer?  This problem happens in
all resolutions/formats.  It does appear that things can be reliably
reassembled, but it sure would be nice if it could be fixed at some lower
level.

In the four high resolution modes, could the fact that the camera is lying
(badly) about the frame rates it is capable of delivering be screwing up
something in the USB layer?  The camera claims 1600x1200 YUV at 30fps, but
delivers at about 6 fps.

One unrelated question in about uvc_video.c is that it appears to me that
if a frame is ended by FID rather than EOF, the sequence number gets
incremented twice?

Any help on how to pursue the packet fragmentation and high resolution
modes would be welcome!

To answer Alexey's question of whether the camera works with the generic
windows driver, it does appear to. In the windows 7 device manager, I
selected the generic usb video driver, and then the one .sys file
(qicflt.sys) no longer appears in the list of files used for the camera.
It does still work. But with only the crapware that came with the 
computer, I don't know if its talking MJPG or YUV.

I don't have that computer with me at the moment, but will post lsusb -v 
as requested later today.

Carl
