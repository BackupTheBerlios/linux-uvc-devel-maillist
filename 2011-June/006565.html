<PRE>Hi again,

here is as attached file a new patch that applies to linux 2.6.39 tree 
(linux-2.6.git, tag v2.6.39).

This patch now prints at the end of each stream :

(*) total number of PTS (taking into account each packet)
(*) total number of SCR
(*) total number of ERR
(*) number of packets without PTS (nb_missing_pts)
(*) number of packets without SCR (nb_missing_scr)

It will print as well for each packet (beware, it will hugely flood your 
syslog) :

(*) SCR
(*) diff with previous packet's SCR
(*) PTS
(*) diff with previous packet's PTS

Beware, to see the &quot;end of stream&quot; statistics, you have to scroll up a 
little bit, it will be somewhere in the end of the per-packet 
information flood.

Some results inline in the e-mail.

</I>I tested with the Logitech HD Pro C910, all packets have a PTS.
PTS are indeed constant through the whole frame as it should be.
&gt;&gt;<i> - how many SCR timestamps do we have per frame ? are they constant through the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole frame or do they vary as they should ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same here !
</I>With the same webcam, all packets have a SCR.
The SCR value does vary through each frame, as it should do.
The difference between the previous SCR is usually the same, except at a 
regular interval where there is a &quot;jump&quot; in SCR values.

for example, SCR - SCR_prev would be 7 times the same difference, and 
then it will change for just one time, and then go back to the old 
difference for 7 times etc.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your review and comments, will submit a new patch ASAP !
