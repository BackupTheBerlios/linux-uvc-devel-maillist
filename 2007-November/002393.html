<PRE>Hello,

Attached you will find a patch that adds iSight support to uvcvideo
and applies to HEAD (revision 140). This patch has existed for some
time now. Initially it was very instrusive to the uvcvideo code, but
this has been fixed.

Please, lets get this reviewed and merged with uvcvideo. It's very
time consuming for me to keep it in sync with uvcvideo head. openSUSE
patches uvcvideo with this patch, Gentoo too, possibly others. It
would make our life much easier if we could get this upstream.

This patch enables the isight camera found in all apple macs fully,
including suspend and resume support.

iSight is an uvc device, but not fully. I am not an expert but it
seems to use a custom packet format on top of the uvc, has different
guid, has partially broken video descriptors and requires firmware.
This patch deals with those in the most intrusive way I could.

Inside the uvcvideo code it will only change the decoding queue if the
device is recognized as an isight device. In addition it will call
uvc_load_firmware during the uvc initialization.

Outside in the self-contained isight.c|h it will handle the firmware
loading, patching the usb descriptors and the decoding.

I would like to express my gratitude to Martin Szulecki who worked
with me on getting the patch in sync with latest uvcvideo and testing
it for the past two days.

Regards,
