<PRE>Hi,

First I have to say I'm sorry for a bit slow reply, the patch didn't  
work out of the box and I had to check out where the problem was...

On 26.11.2008, at 5.21, Laurent Pinchart wrote:
&gt;<i> This is not completely true. Controls are added to the entity

</I>
Ah, in that case it is true because of how they are sorted. I didn't  
dare to count on it though...

&gt;&gt;<i> However it works again for me and that's what matters now. I hope

</I>&gt;<i> Could you please test the patch and report the results ?
</I>
I agree that this version is cleaner than mine, at least it doesn't  
free memory blocks and hold the mutex while doing it. :) Also adding  
the device quirk was something that I was thinking should be added  
but wanted to ask for comments first.

The latest patch had a small thinko though, you wrote &quot;entity- 
 &gt;extension&quot; in the controls and size getting when it should be  
&quot;entity-&gt;processing&quot; in this case. I'll attach a new tested version  
of the patch where that is fixed, it should have no other changes.  
Thanks again and tell let me know if there's something else I could/ 
should do. :)
