Damn, I tried to hide it since I'm not really entitled to, but it seems
I failed. :p

</I>
Yes, I think this probably had something to do with the modprobe
failing, I should try to hunt down all outdated versions.

&gt;<i> You could also try to load the new modules with insmod. You will have to

</I>&gt;<i> but you will be able to make sure the new modules are loaded and not some old

</I>
In fact, what I tried to do first, was to remove all v4l related modules
and start to insmod them one by one. Now that I tried again, I think it
was my fault (naturally) and I think I had wrong version of
v4l1_compat.ko loaded. It's a bit funny that videodev.ko depends on
v4l1_compat.ko, but that's another issue.

Just for documentation if someone else has similar problems, the correct
order to load modules is:

insmod v4l1-compat.ko
insmod videodev.ko
insmod v4l2-compat-ioctl32.ko
insmod uvcvideo.ko

And apparently the v4l2_common.ko I mentioned before is not used at
all... I'm not sure if the ioctl32 compat is required because I'm
running on x86-64, but anyway at least I needed it.

Thank you again a lot for your help, I hope this information is helpful
for someone, at least now I know the dependencies. Stupid mistake in the
beginning again, but I had just missed the v4l1 when grepping for v4l2...
