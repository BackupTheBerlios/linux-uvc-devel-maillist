As your camera supports YUV only, the '-f uvc' argument is required. The error 
message returned by luvcview in [Exhibit 4] is thus normal.

I'm a bit puzzled as well. The camera has been listed as supported based on a 
user report I received on April the 27th, 2008. I haven't heard of any issue 
similar to the one you experienced.

Could you please try setting the quirks parameter to 4 when loading the 
uvcvideo driver ?

# modprobe uvcvideo quirks=4

If the driver is already loaded, make sure you unload it first.

# rmmod uvcvideo

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
