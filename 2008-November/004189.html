Thanks for the analysis. I agree with your conclusion, the camera hasn't 
changed its capture resolution.

&gt;<i> &gt; As a side note, make sure you check the kernel log (dmesg) for uvcvideo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; error messages when performing your tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No errors in kernel for my model. I made some debug info with controls

</I>&gt;<i> It does so when i play it using mplayer <A HREF="tv:///,">tv:///,</A> i dont know what does that

</I>
Nothing to worry about. 0x00980909 is V4L2_CID_AUDIO_MUTE and is not supported 
by UVC devices.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is here possible to disable, these resolutions for this camera
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The resolutions are reported by the camera itself. The UVC driver merely
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pass the data to userspace without any modification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are reported but not working. R5u870 driver seems to be not
</I>&gt;<i> developed now, as work is put to upload firmware and then handle camera
</I>&gt;<i> using uvcvideo.
</I>
Did resolutions other than 640x480 ever worked with the r5u870 driver ?

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; or make software image resize ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The driver doesn't resize or process the image in any way. This kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function belongs to userspace.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; luvcview reports the following resolutions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; $ lucview -L

</I>&gt;<i> Where can i get newer version? i found this most recent one at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Investigation/uvc/">http://mxhaard.free.fr/spca50x/Investigation/uvc/</A> but i have older
</I>&gt;<i> version it seems.
</I>
You can grab the latest version from the quickcamteam.net SVN repository at 
<A HREF="http://svn.quickcamteam.net/svn/luvcview/">http://svn.quickcamteam.net/svn/luvcview/</A>

&gt;<i> Also, my luvcview will not show anything to me, it fails with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> luvcview version 0.2.1
</I>&gt;<i> Video driver: x11
</I>&gt;<i> A window manager is available
</I>&gt;<i> video /dev/video0
</I>&gt;<i> Unable to set format: 22.
</I>&gt;<i>  Init v4L2 failed !! exit fatal
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you where it could fail or how could i fix this? I tried different
</I>&gt;<i> formats and sizes, but i never saw image from luvcview.
</I>
luvcview (at least its old versions) defaulted to MJPEG even if the camera 
doesn't support that format. You can force YUYV with

luvcview -f yuv

&gt;<i> Mplayer <A HREF="tv:///">tv:///</A> will work (1.0rc2-4.2.3), as is cheese 2.22.3. xawtv will
</I>&gt;<i> choose wrong resolution and i dont know how to change it. It worked with
</I>&gt;<i> r5u870 driver.
</I>
What resolution did xawtv pick with the r5u870 driver ?

&gt;<i> But Mplayer has somehow strange colors, image from cheese is better in
</I>&gt;<i> quality.
</I>
That might be caused by default control values chosen by mplayer and cheese, 
especially the hue control.

&gt;<i> &gt; Please note that the r5u870 chipset is not completely UVC compliant and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is currently not officially supported by the UVC driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know about anything exactly that this camera does not support as
</I>&gt;<i> it should?
</I>
There are a number of UVC non compliance issues with the r5u870 chipset:

- The chipset advertises UVC descriptors when no firmware is loaded. It won't 
re-enumerate or change its descriptors after firmware loading. This makes 
initialisation quite difficult.

- Some proprietary controls supported by the camera are not advertised in its 
descriptors and are only accessible through a proprietary protocol. The UVC 
driver has no way to access those controls.

- As you reported, resolutions other than 640x480 seem to be broken. More 
investigation is probably required.

&gt;<i> I would like to get it working with uvcvideo module and i may 
</I>&gt;<i> try to create patch, but i dont understand well how is resolution
</I>&gt;<i> switching done in UVC video module. Would it be fixed with some custom
</I>&gt;<i> quirk for example? iSight has some special, why not this?
</I>
The uvcvideo driver supports some non-standard cameras using device-specific 
quirks. The iSight is the worst example of such devices. Still, it only 
overrides very specific portion of the driver's logic. Supporting r5u870 
chipsets in the uvcvideo driver would require introducing hooks pretty much 
all over the place and I'm not happy with that. r5u870-based cameras are far 
from being UVC compliant, and for the time being they are better served by a 
separate driver.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
