Not really surprising, the driver waits in VIDIOC_DQBUF for a video buffer to 
be ready. This is supposed to be interruptible though.

</I>&gt;<i> initialization.
</I>
I've compared the two traces (both kernel log messages and libv4l) and they 
are identical for the initialisation part.

Two things bother me. First of all, libv4l spams the the driver (and thus the 
camera) with VIDIOC_TRY_FMT requests. Given the fragile state of many webcam 
firmwares, I wouldn't be surprised if some of them would simply crash.

Then, and this might be the real issue here, the application calls 
VIDIOC_S_FMT but libv4l doesn't relay that to the driver. I suppose there's a 
check in the library that compares the requested format with the current 
format and returns immediately if they are identical. This means the camera 
doesn't receive any set format request between the two runs. I wouldn't be 
surprised if camera developers never expected that.

As a quick workaround, could you please try the attached patch ? It modifies 
device initialisation to make sure a set format request is send right before 
starting the video stream.

&gt;<i> Another thing, I'm a bit confused about the place uvcvideo development
</I>&gt;<i> is going on at the moment. I see you sent me a patch against svn but I
</I>&gt;<i> believed uvc was included upstream so development was going on on
</I>&gt;<i> linuxtv mercurial repos.. isn't it so?
</I>
I'm moving from the SVN repository on Berlios to Mercurial on linuxtv.org. It 
was easier for me yesterday to generate the patch against SVN.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
