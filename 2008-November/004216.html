<PRE>Laurent,
Here is the request dmesg output when controls start to fail:

[  152.923415] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 9) :
-32 (exp. 4).
[  153.588159] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 9) :

[  155.984162] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 9) :

[  156.285167] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 9) :

[  156.584167] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 9) :
-110 (exp. 4).

I was just paning left and right and after a while the camera just
stopped responding, video is still streaming ok.
all other controls also stopped responding (see brightness control below):

[  500.896084] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 2 (unit 2) :
-110 (exp. 2).
[  501.197589] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 2 (unit 2) :
-110 (exp. 2).
[  501.496091] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 2 (unit 2) :
-110 (exp. 2).
[  501.796591] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 2 (unit 2) :
-110 (exp. 2).
[  502.096092] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 2 (unit 2) :
-110 (exp. 2).
[  502.396094] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 2 (unit 2) :
-110 (exp. 2).

The funny thing is that this only seems to occur after a kernel update.
I didn't seem to be able to replicate the problem before, but then I
run an update
and it installed kernel 2.6.27.8, after booting with the new kernel It
just failed almost
immediately (I had the camera connected).

When I try to restart guvcview I get the following in dmesg:

[  913.960151] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 0) :
-110 (exp. 26).
[  914.960146] uvcvideo: Failed to query (1) UVC control 1 (unit 0) :
-110 (exp. 26).

guvcview fails with  &quot;Unable to set format: 5.&quot;

After replugging the camera everything seems to be working fine and I
can no longer
replicate this issue.

This is consistent with previous kernel updates (I always have to
disconnect the camera
after the update).

In my case it's not a big problem, I just don't understand why is this
necessary.

Best regards,
Paulo
