This is not completely true. Controls are added to the entity controls list in 
ascending index order, so manual controls will always come before auto 
controls (at least for the processing unit).

&gt;<i> However it works again for me and that's what matters now. I hope to get
</I>&gt;<i> this thing resolved some day in the official version too though. :)
</I>
Let's work on this then :-)

The patch indeed looked a bit messy at first. I've been trying to rework it 
for the past hour but ran into various issues and I now understand 
implementing a clean solution is not as easy as it might seem.

There are several places where control blacklisting can be implemented. If we 
want to use information taken from uvc_control_info (such as the control 
selector) the location you picked is the right one. However, the driver then 
needs to walk the entities and controls lists over again and free data 
allocated during the initialisation process.

Another solution would be to blacklist controls before they are allocated. We 
would then process the bmControls bitmask instead of the controls list. This 
approach is more efficient, but probably less generic as it won't allow the 
driver to blacklist controls based on advanced information taken from 
uvc_control_info.

As both solutions have advantages and drawbacks let's remember Linus Torvald 
and his famous quote about overdesign. Here's a simplified version of the 
patch that optionally (based on a device quirk) removes processing unit auto 
controls when no corresponding manual control is available.

Could you please test the patch and report the results ?

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
