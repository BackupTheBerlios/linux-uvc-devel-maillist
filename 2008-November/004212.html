</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this really turns out to be a problem we need to look into this. Would

</I>
If the driver supports it, ENUM_FRAMESIZE is much better. This is exactly what 
is was designed for after all. TRY_FMT should then be used after the format 
and size has been selected from the enumerated list as the last step in 
format negotiation.

In this specific case I don't think the tsunami of TRY_FMT requests annoyed 
the camera, so there's no hurry. It could even be a good hardware stress 
test :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Then, and this might be the real issue here, the application calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VIDIOC_S_FMT but libv4l doesn't relay that to the driver. I suppose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's a check in the library that compares the requested format with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the current format and returns immediately if they are identical. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means the camera doesn't receive any set format request between the two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; runs. I wouldn't be surprised if camera developers never expected that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct, libv4l tries to cause as little IO as possible.

Laurent Pinchart
