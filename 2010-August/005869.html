I can't accept that patch as-is, for several reasons.

First of all, the patch maps V4L2 buffers to userspace in non-cacheable mode. 
This will potentially degrade performances. Platforms that have a PIPT or non-
aliasing VIPT cache (x86 comes to mind, as well as several ARM processors) 
don't require this patch, so there will be a performance impact for the vast 
majority of uvcvideo users with no added benefit (I'm thinking about the x86 
desktop).

Then, even on ARM platforms with a VIVT or aliasing VIPT cache, the patch is 
not correct. The V4L2 buffers are mapped once in kernel space using a normal 
mapping. Your patch makes the second (userspace) mapping uncacheable, and the 
ARM specification clearly forbids different mappings with different attributes 
for the same memory region.

The only correct fix I can think of at the moment is to munmap() buffers 
before queuing them, and mmap()ing them after dequeuing them. There's 
obviously a performance hit, but that's the price to pay for correctness. 
Other solutions might be possible, but they won't be straightforward and will 
require changes to the ARM memory management core. Maybe this should be 
explored on the linux-arm-kernel mailing list.
