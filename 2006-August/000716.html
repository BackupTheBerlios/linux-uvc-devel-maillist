<PRE>From, Mr.Adnan Harmoudi.

National Bank of Abu Dhabi
Dubai Branch United Arab Emirate (U.A.E.).
Private Email:( <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/linux-uvc-devel">mradnanh at hotmail.com</A>).



I am Mr.Adnan Harmoudi, Branch Manager National Bank of Dubai, 
I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.

A British Oil consultant and contractor with the Kruger Gold Company, Mr.Donald Heck, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his Contract employers, the Kruger Gold Company that Mr.Donald Heck died in a plane crash along with his wife Ms.Jeanne, Mr.Donald Heck died in a plan crash along with his wife in Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air crash.

Since we got this information about his death and on further Investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Donald Heck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.

This money is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to Laws of United Arab Emirates, at the expiration of 8 (Eight) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the (U.A.E) Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to Stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Donald Heck so that the fruits of This old man's labor will not get into the hands of some government Officials.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and Notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and Letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager Guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

If you are interested, upon your response I shall then provide you with more details that will help you understand the transaction.

Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy ommunication.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this Transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall Require your assistance to invest my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply
Regards.

Mr. Adnan Harmoudi.
  
</PRE>
