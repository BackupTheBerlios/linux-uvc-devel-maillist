</I>Not true, the actual semantics of capture are as follows:
1. Initialize camera
2. Set reference time
3. Capture frames continuously in a loop
3. If (reference_time - current_time) &gt; delay
	write current captured frame to file
	set new reference time

This reason this must be done is because the camera seems to need to
&quot;warm up&quot; after init, otherwise the pictures it takes have colour/white
balance problems.

</I>
This is beginning to sound like you may need to write something up
yourself to meet these requirements. The kind of timing you're taking
about probably needs threads and kernel-mode timers.

&gt;<i> To fix this, I have thought to do following. Let me know if they have
</I>&gt;<i> got any merit and please suggest the best way to achieve it.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. uvccapture gives .jpg image as output. If it instead outputs raw
</I>&gt;<i> data, I think it will execute faster. And hence overall time delay
</I>&gt;<i> between first and third would not significant. I shall later convert RAW
</I>&gt;<i> image into JPG.
</I>
As long as you're not adding the -m flag, or changing the camera's
width/height output, its default format is a MJPEG image, and I just add
a JPEG header to the data, there is no conversion involved (comes out of
the camera/driver this way). If you do need a different width/height
than default, you could remove the call to compress_yuyv_to_jpeg, and
write the raw YUYV data to a file.

&gt;<i> 2. Can the stream capture be parallelized for the three devices such
</I>&gt;<i> that they seem to capture the scene all at once? 
</I>
I suspect its certainly possible to parallelize the capture for the
devices, but this isn't what uvccapture is designed to do, its just to
snap webcam pics for automated website posting or such. Perhaps you
should investigate interfacing directly to the uvc driver with your
application needing the images (if you need them in real time).
