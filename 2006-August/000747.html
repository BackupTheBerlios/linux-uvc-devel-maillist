Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to a European private firm where the final crediting was expected to carry out. While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his Involvement in politics by financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Borris Nemtsov and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party Led by Gregor Yavlinsky which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin Second Tenure as Russian president.

YOUR ROLE: 
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the consignment and I will re-profile the funds in the consignment with your name, which will enable the European firm transfer the consignment to you.Presently I have moved out of  Russia,I have decided to use this sum to relocate to outside Europe and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates.
