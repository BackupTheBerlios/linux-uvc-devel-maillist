<PRE>Hi,

I remember Laurent was doing some tests with that patch but I'm not sure  
what the results were. I think part of it went into the change applied in  
r42 but I don't know if that's enough to make it work with the iSight.

You should know that the iSight doesn't even claim UVC support and from  
what I've heard the streaming headers are completely different. So  
distributions applying patches to the UVC driver for that is a rather bad  
idea unless properly done.

&gt;<i> 2. Taking the svn sources and apply the 'usb-reset' patch by Alexandre

</I>&gt;<i> This patch is a life saver. Without it the USB subsystem can become

</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible to include this patch into the main codebase, or

</I>
We're still trying to find a better (from a technical point of view)  
solution than what the USB reset patch provides. The error seems to be in  
the camera and we want to find a way to avoid triggering the USB errors.

In the meantime, adding the patch to the project page sounds like a good  
idea. I'll talk to Laurent when he returns (he's away for a couple of  
days).

&gt;<i> Last, maybe it helps, Logitech has support for 3rd party developers (I
</I>&gt;<i> emailed them reminding them about Linux customers).  Information can
</I>&gt;<i> be found here:  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/partners/select/US/EN,crid=932,categoryid=218">http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/partners/select/US/EN,crid=932,categoryid=218</A>
</I>
Don't worry, we're aware of the Linux customers and we're actively working  
on Linux software. Expect some news before the end of the year. :-)

Cheers,
Martin
