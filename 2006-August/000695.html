<PRE>Hi Gabriel,

About error:
Yes, you are right. They indeed are the same. It usually comes when I
try to use -t&lt;k&gt; option to grab the frames after every &lt;k&gt; seconds, by
the way this feature does not work. My guess is that after each grabbing
it initializes the stream and available time of &lt;k&gt; seconds falls short
of what is required for initialization. For any further attempt to read
the device using &quot;uvccapture and luvcview&quot;, it outputs &quot;Init V4l2&quot;
error. 

The problem, however, is fixed when I log off and log in again.

About simultaneous capture:
As I said I am using 3 cameras. I have used three separate commands to
capture the images from /dev/device0, /dev/device1, /dev/device2. But
there is a problem. All three commands are executed one after another
and hence, three different shots don't remain simultaneous shots. I need
it for 3D reconstruction of the moving object in the scene. And posture
of the object seems to vary a lot in all three views of it.

To fix this, I have thought to do following. Let me know if they have
got any merit and please suggest the best way to achieve it.
1. uvccapture gives .jpg image as output. If it instead outputs raw
data, I think it will execute faster. And hence overall time delay
between first and third would not significant. I shall later convert RAW
image into JPG.

2. Can the stream capture be parallelized for the three devices such
that they seem to capture the scene all at once? 

Thanks,
Ajay

This looks suspiciously similar to the issue you were having with
luvcview, are you trying to use the read switch which is not supported
by the uvc driver? uvccapture is a derivative of luvcview, so the core
error messages are mostly the same.

&gt;<i> Moreover, I need to grab frames simultaneously from different cameras.

&gt;<i> If I grab the frames one after another. I am sure there will be some

</I>
You can just run two instances of uvccapture each with a different
device option (-d /dev/video0 and another /dev/video1) This way you have
independent control of each of the capture options, and filenames
