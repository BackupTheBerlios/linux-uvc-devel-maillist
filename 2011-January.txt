I'm confused, as you're not the person who replied to my thread. In
any case, you just send a message to linux-uvc-devel at lists.berlios.de,
as you did..

Is there any reason to keep quoting text that isn't relevant to your
question? Also, is the "I try to fill the form ..." part of your
question? If so, what form? Are you talking about this:
http://lists.berlios.de/mailman/admin/linux-uvc-devel ? If so, why?
You're already subscribed to the list, obviously..

If you want to provide information about your device, then just send
an email to linux-uvc-devel at lists.berlios.de (as you seemingly have
managed to do) with the details in. If you're wondering which details
to provide, then one of the developers can help with that, but I
imagine that the output of

lsusb -v -d id

is sufficient, where "id" is the USB vendor and product pair that you
get from lsusb (e.g. 064e:d101 for my webcam).

Does that help?

Nicky Chorley

Message-ID: <006501cbaba0$3c1cd270$b4567750$@com>

Hi, I am a recent incorporation to this list.

 

I really don't know if this is the right list to expose a doubt, so you'll
tell:

 

I want to control the webcam from a service. 

Only turn on or turn off the camera programmatically (or fade the image and
the sound to black, programmatically too).

 

Can I do that using UVC driver?

 

I've tried to "rmmod -f" the module without success :-(

 

Thanks in advance :-)

Hi All,
Most USB device controller drivers don't support ISO endpoints, but BULK is

I've got "Creative WebCam Live! Chat IM". It is UVC-compatible, but
it's not listed in the supported devices list (
http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc/#devices ).

One problem: it works with ~10?15 fps and with 800x600 resolution.
Box/pack says "Frame rate: Up to 30fps @ 800x600 pixels (Software
enhanced)".
Does anybody know how to increase fps?

Hi,
Did you notice the "(Software enhanced)" remark ?
This means a lower resolution is used to achieve the 30 fps and then
the windows driver resizes the image frame to 800x600 (through
software).
The linux uvc driver (like any other v4l2 driver) just exposes the
"real" resolutions and frame rates supplied by the hardware. All image
processing must be done by userspace applications.

Regards,
Paulo

I understand that frame can be resized using interpolation by the
userspace software. But fps, how is it possible? This software makes
in-between frames using smth like morphing?

If someone knows how to do that using userspace software in GNU/Linux
? please, let me know.


Best regards,
Alexander.

Doesn't your camera supports 30 fps at a lower resolution than 800x600 ?

I've made mistake in the first message, I'm sorry. My camera works
with 640x480 and ~10?15 fps.

I run "mplayer tv://" and see 640x480 resolution and less than 30 fps.
If I run "mplayer tv:// -fps 10" ? I see the same frame speed.
"mplayer tv:// -fps 5" ? I really see 5 fps.

I really don't care in which resolution my camera should work, but I
want to get 30 fps.

Also, my CPU load is ~25%, the video card works with hardware
acceleration. I've tried different mplayer video drivers (xv, gl2,
etc) and I see the same result.

You may need to disable autoexposure.
Could you please try it with guvcview ?

If you could also post the output of 'guvcview --verbose' it would be
great, as it prints out your camera full control list (and supported
framesizes and frame rates).

Paulo

I run guvcview and picked on "show" checkbox near "frame rate" line at
the "video & files" tab. I always see 7 fps at the window's manager
panel. I've tried to set the smaller resolutions than 640x480 and I
got the same result.
I've attached "guvcview --verbose" output.

Hi!
Bought a "Microsoft LifeCam VX-700" today, workes fine right out of the box using the UVC driver, Device-Id 045e:0770.
(Device has a build-in mircophone which I have not tested yet -- not sure if mircrophone is UVC-related, is it?)
Regards
Thilo

OK,
So the camera claims to support 640x480 at 30 fps, but I guess you need
to manually set exposure for that.
Just set the "Exposure, Auto" control to manual and adjust "Exposure
(Absolute)" to a level where you get the 30 fps ( the image will
probably get very dark, in this case you will need to use a brighter
light source).

Regards,
Paulo

I'd rather say that the driver starts receiving the next frame between 
103.237764 and 103.239244. As there's no buffer left at that point the frame 
is dropped.

What puzzles me is why your application doesn't start dequeuing (and 
requeuing) buffers at 103.129925, when the first frame is complete. It lets 
the buffers queue get empty, resulting in frame drop.

Your camera seems to crash when you try to read the current value of the 
brightness, contrast and hue controls. Does it happen randomly, or every time 
you try to access those controls ?

Please send me the output of

Does the camera work correctly ?

Do you mean that that webcam works properly with the uvcvideo driver ? If so, 
please send me the output of

If I understand you correctly, you have an application that streams video from 
a UVC device, and you want to stop that video stream (or fade it to black) 
from anothere application. The uvcvideo driver can't do that. This kind of 
policy must be implemented in userspace by making the applications communicate 
with eachother.

kill -9 the application using the webcam, the effect will be similar :-)

I haven't tried bulk mode recently, but I know I got it working some time ago 
(maybe with a different code base though).

I don't think that's caused by CPU time being spent in the kernel. The driver 
timestamps the buffer when the first packet is received. Your application will 
get the buffer when the last packet is received. If the delay is around 1s, 
that probably means that the camera only sends one frame per second.

One possible reason for that would be auto-exposure. Have you tried disabling 
auto-exposure and setting the exposure time manually to a low value ?

You will have to ask that on the linux-media mailing list. I know there was a

For example samsung S3C:

        case USB_ENDPOINT_XFER_ISOC:

Yes. i have tried to change ISO to BULK, but i haven't made the bulk
mode gadget work yet. Do you still remember what you have changed? Or
can you find the codes and share with me?

Hi Laurent:
     I had solved it, because the hardware init work needs 300 milliseconds,
i only modified the
 unicap-devel to get defaults value after waiting 300 milliseconds.

Thank you very much!

That's not UVC compliant and should have been fixed on the device. The device 
should delay USB enumeration until hardware is properly initialized.

Correct, someone wrote a patch for libv4l to use ffmpeg's jpeg decoder
I nacked this, because ffmpeg is not in all major distributions because
of licensing issues. In the same thread I expressed interest in adding
support to libv4l for using libjpeg to do the decompression of regular
jpeg (we will need to keep the tinyjpeg copy around for special
jpeg variants like pjpg). Note adding libjpeg supports also automatically
adds support for libjpeg-turbo, which is API and even ABI compatible.

Hans

Message-ID: <4D2B1038.4090306@kymp.net>

Hi,

I just bought Logitech c905 webcam and wanted to inform that it works 
out of the box on Fedora 14.
(kernel 2.6.35.10-74.fc14.x86_64) Device id is 046d:080a.

(I'd send output of lsusb -v -d 046d:080a but the file is 66k and the 
mailing-list allows only 40k attachments.)

Subject: [Linux-uvc-devel] UVC XU Questions
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=5wAyNOt=KhqZcc3PLrsTnOs_hxMhxDoPOte_G@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.  My name is Brent Weatherall.  I am new to developing with the UVC.
 I am developing in Linux.  I have a device that uses an extension unit.
 Looking at the device's last generation of software for the extension unit
portion of the device I do not see 100% of the correlation with the UVC XU
documentation.  The old device code (which functions properly) does not
actually use the extension descriptor in the software at all, yet it works
anyway.  The extension descriptor does not show up in the uvcvideo.h file
either.  My questions are as follows:

1. Is this XU descriptor something agreed upon on paper and then implemented
solely inside the device?
2. When sending the first xu control via ioctl to activate the specified xu
control, is the bUnitID from the descriptor specification the same thing as
the "__u8 unit" field in the data structure "struct uvc_xu_control"?
3. Is it correct that when using an XU control, it takes two ioctl commands?
 One to specify the control to use, and then one to actually get/send the
control data?
4. If 3 is correct, when sending the first xu control via ioctl, what should
be put in the '__u8 selector', '__u16 size' and '__u8 *data' fields?
5. How does one determine the size of an XU control?

Sorry if these questions are basic or should be obvious; however, they are
not clear to me at this time from reading the UVC documentation.

Thanks.

Brent

Radek,
Please attach the full dmesg output when starting video capture with
the second camera.
Also increase log verbosity first:

something like this:
rmmod uvcvideo
modprobe uvcvideo trace=65535

You should also refer your capture settings (if I remember MJPG
640x480 at 24 fps) and that if you use one c910 and one c600 everything
works fine.

Note: Cc linux-media since you also posted this thread there.

Regards,
Paulo

Subject: [Linux-uvc-devel] webcam for skype under Ubuntu
Message-ID: <AANLkTikJSLDyAcpzS+KDDu4dwwQJJi-CXrKp2wADaS7z@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all:
I intend to buy a webcam for video conference meeting over skype under Ubuntu.
1. Shall I buy any webcam will be fine?
2. or I have to buy the webcam that is certificated by Skype.

if 2 is the correct choice, is there anything special for skype certification?
software compatibility?

Subject: [Linux-uvc-devel] [new cam] 0408:1fc3 buildin webcam on fujisu
	lifebook a340
Message-ID: <1295168273.14638.27.camel@asaminew-LIFEBOOK-A530>

Hi,
i helping my friend to install linux on his new laptop "fujisu lifebook
a340". It is cheap one (350?) but seems to work good with linux. But web
cam has some issues, which i will discuss with you.

It is uvc webcam (0408:1fc3 Quanta Computer, Inc.). For most frame sizes
it aims to support 10, 15,25, 30 fps. In real life it stream only with
30fps, if i try to set 10fps, it will silently ignore it. The real
problem - there is no exposure control and autoexposure do not working
with 30fps too. So with normal light the image will be dark and noisy.

With frame sizes 1280x960 and 1280x1024, it has max frame rate 9fps
(aims to support 9 and 5 fps). Interesting thing is, autoexposure seems
to work here. If i close the cam, frame rate will drop to ~4fps, and if
i add extra light it will go to ~9fps. The image with this framerate is
better than with 30fps.

By tracing i also found "uvcvideo: Dropping payload (out of sync)."
messages. So i added two quirks for this cam: UVC_QUIRK_STREAM_NO_FID
for out of sync; UVC_QUIRK_RESTRICT_FRAME_RATE for dummy frame rates.

Now my question: is it possible to pull/force some registers to test if
auto exposure can work with 30fps too?
If not, is it possible to notify user space about broken auto exposure?
So user space apps can make right decision?

PS: in attachment is quirks_patch, and lsusb.

Regards,
	Alexey

I have found a guy (Tom Harper) who helped me with that. He is saying that:

The other problem is with its MJPEG. It uses restart markers a lot (so
that MJPEG decoding could be speed up with parallelization) but for
example ffmpeg does not support that without his patch, which they
have not approved:

Yes. That was me. After I wrote here I decided that I will do it myself. ;-)

I agree with that. But I think that libjpeg-turbo is the only way to
go for this high frame sizes. The problem is only that libjpeg-turbo
does support restart markers. I hope this just means that it decodes
such frames slower:

http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/About/Performance

So as it seems ffmpeg does have problems with decoding such frames
(you get garbage) this is one more reason to go with libjpeg(-turbo).

You should not connect it to the same USB controller. It could be that
one takes too much bandwidth. This camera already pushes USB bandwidth
to its limits. Try distributing camera among different USB
controllers.

I think if this was bandwidth related the error returned by the driver
would be different, besides the bandwidth required for the c600 is the
same and it works with this one.
The camera just seems to crash, even controls stop responding.

Actually why I post this mail because I want to know what kind of
specific Technics that Skype need for certification.
there are a lot of webcams that are UVC compatible, but I found there
is seldom webcam that is skype certificated.
If UVC compatible webcams are ok for skype, that means we don't need
to care about skype certification, right?
thanks a lot,
miloody

I wouldn't care about this type of certification.
If the camera as a working v4l2 driver then it should work with any v4l2 app.
In the case of skype, since from what I know it only supports yuv
formats, you may need to preload v4l2convert (from libv4l) to handle

As you mention libv4l, you might also want to use this lib to circumvent another issue in Skype, or you could select your camera appropriately

Here are libv4l's changelogs mentioning it:

http://lists-archives.org/video4linux/24677-libv4l-release-0-5-1-the-skype-release.html
http://lists-archives.org/video4linux/25270-libv4l-release-0-5-4.html

That is: Skype for Linux only supports certain resolutions which some cameras may not provide. (libv4l fixes this. :-))

Otherwise one gets the following in dmesg:

uvcvideo: Failed to query (131) UVC probe control : -110 (exp. 26).
uvcvideo: Failed to set UVC probe control : -110 (exp. 26).
...

That causes skype at least to core/hang on first
open of /dev/video0 but work on subsequent runs.

cheers,

I use a Logitech C905 with Skype in Kubuntu regularly and it is great.

Cam worked fine with all applications until a part-time dual istallation of 
Win XP.

Since then i only get a quarter (upper left) of the Cam's view, with cheese 
i could set it to a unnatural resolution of 1280x1024 for showing me the 
whole view, but ignored by e.g. skype - and still a extremely dark picture 
probably only with b/w content and completely wrong refresh-rate.

Already tried to reinstall XP for maybe being allowed to "reset" the cam's 
settings to get it to work again with the ubuntustudio 10.04, no success 
yet.

I'd appreciate it if you could give some helping ideas.

Regards,
Benny

can you please send ouput of this command "uvcdynctrl -f"

what do you mean with refresh rate? if frame rate, do you mean it is too
high?

Please install "gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad" and try this command:

gst-launch-0.10 -v v4l2src ! video/x-raw-yuv,width=640,height=480 !
ffmpegcolorspace ! fpsdisplaysink

It will display frame rate on the screen, so tell what framreate do you
get.

Ok, i thought you get images where 3/4 will be black and 1/4 is actual
image. Now i see it looks more like zoom (like sw zoom on my logitech). 

Seems like your problem is the eeprom (sort of BIOS) of your webcam. It
store Usb ID (0402:5606) and default settings. Normally it should be
write protected, but if your changes made in windows appear in linux
(after reboot and complete poweroff), then your windows app can
overwrite eeprom. This is really horror scenario.

I do not have any other reasonable explanation. Any other ideas?

This project for UVC (USB Video Class) webcams. Unfortunately your
webcam is not one of that.

There was one project trying to provide a linux closed source driver for
your cam:
http://www.linux-projects.org/modules/news/
with some luck, you'll get your cam  for 5? or 7$ to work:
http://www.linux-projects.org/downloads/sn9cxxx-unlimited.html

So if you add some money, you can by some good UVC webcam.

 WebCam SCB-0370N (Samsung SF510)
Message-ID: <4D387ACA.9050800@dit.upm.es>


Dear folks,

I have installed Ubuntu Linux in a Samsung SF510, which has a WebCam 
SCB-0370N (ID 2232:1001)

Whenever I change dynamically the grab size, my video program hangs.
The code has been tested in a pretty good bunch of cameras handled by 
the uvcvideo driver.

(For example, the Microsoft LifeCam Cinema(TM), or the Logitech "UVC 
Camera (046d:0994)"- don't remember the product name).

Have anyone experience any problem with this camera?

Gabriel Huecas
P.D. I also submit this info to "Ubuntu Forum", but I think this is a 
better place

Hi Laurent,
I make some changes in your drivers to support bulk:

1. in f_uvc.c, delete uvc_streaming_intf alt1 for iso video since bulk
doesn't need alt1 :
static struct usb_interface_descriptor uvc_streaming_intf_alt0 __initdata =
{
    .bLength        = USB_DT_INTERFACE_SIZE,
    .bDescriptorType    = USB_DT_INTERFACE,
    .bInterfaceNumber   = UVC_INTF_VIDEO_STREAMING,
    .bAlternateSetting  = 0,
//  .bNumEndpoints      = 0,
    .bNumEndpoints      = 1,
    .bInterfaceClass    = USB_CLASS_VIDEO,
    .bInterfaceSubClass = 0x02,
    .bInterfaceProtocol = 0x00,
    .iInterface     = 0,
};

+/*
static struct usb_interface_descriptor uvc_streaming_intf_alt1 __initdata =
{
    .bLength        = USB_DT_INTERFACE_SIZE,
    .bDescriptorType    = USB_DT_INTERFACE,
    .bInterfaceNumber   = UVC_INTF_VIDEO_STREAMING,
    .bAlternateSetting  = 1,
    .bNumEndpoints      = 1,
    .bInterfaceClass    = USB_CLASS_VIDEO,
    .bInterfaceSubClass = 0x02,
    .bInterfaceProtocol = 0x00,
    .iInterface     = 0,
};
+*/
static struct usb_endpoint_descriptor uvc_streaming_ep = {
    .bLength        = USB_DT_ENDPOINT_SIZE,
    .bDescriptorType    = USB_DT_ENDPOINT,
    .bEndpointAddress   = USB_DIR_IN,
    .bmAttributes       = USB_ENDPOINT_XFER_BULK,
    .wMaxPacketSize     = cpu_to_le16(512),
//  .bInterval      = 1,
};

static const struct usb_descriptor_header * const uvc_fs_streaming[] = {
//  (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uvc_streaming_intf_alt1,
    (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uvc_streaming_ep,
    NULL,
};

static const struct usb_descriptor_header * const uvc_hs_streaming[] = {
//  (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uvc_streaming_intf_alt1,
    (struct usb_descriptor_header *) &uvc_streaming_ep,
    NULL,
};

2.in uvc_video.c, I didn't find you have any chance to initialize
video->max_payload_size and move to bulk mode, then i added one line :
+   video->max_payload_size = 512;

    if (video->max_payload_size) {
        video->encode = uvc_video_encode_bulk;
        video->payload_size = 0;
    } else {
        video->encode = uvc_video_encode_isoc;
    }

Now windows can detect the webcam and even enable video stream, but image is
not right.

Then i need your help about the right init value for video->max_payload_size
in uvc_video.c, and point out the right value for dwMaxPayloadTransferSize in
userspace program uvc_gadget.c too:
static void
uvc_events_init(struct uvc_device *dev)
{
    struct v4l2_event_subscription sub;

    uvc_fill_streaming_control(dev, &dev->probe, 0, 0);
    uvc_fill_streaming_control(dev, &dev->commit, 0, 0);

    if (dev->bulk) {
        /* FIXME Crude hack, must be negotiated with the driver. */
        dev->probe.dwMaxPayloadTransferSize = 16 * 1024;
        dev->commit.dwMaxPayloadTransferSize = 16 * 1024;
    }

    memset(&sub, 0, sizeof sub);
    sub.type = UVC_EVENT_SETUP;
    ioctl(dev->fd, VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT, &sub);
    sub.type = UVC_EVENT_DATA;
    ioctl(dev->fd, VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT, &sub);
    sub.type = UVC_EVENT_STREAMON;
    ioctl(dev->fd, VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT, &sub);
    sub.type = UVC_EVENT_STREAMOFF;
    ioctl(dev->fd, VIDIOC_SUBSCRIBE_EVENT, &sub);
}

You said "FIXME Crude hack, must be negotiated with the driver", do you mean
16*1024 should be the value of video->max_payload_size in uvc_video.c?

Can you try your best to give us more information about bulk since you have
already had some bulk codes in both drivers and userspace utilities?

Thanks
Barry

The XU descriptor is sent by the device to the host. The uvcvideo driver 
parses the XU descriptor when initializing the device to understand the 
entities topology and instantiate controls.

Yes it is.

> get/send the control data?

To address a control the uvcvideo driver needs its control selector, which is 
a 8-bit value. Unfortunately that value can't be retrieved from the XU 
descriptor. For that reason the uvcvideo driver needs to be told in advance 
about the mappings between XU controls and control selectors. That's what the 
UVCIOC_CTRL_ADD ioctl is for. You only need to call it once to add an XU 
control, and you can then get/set the control value as many times as you want.

In practice I've found that UVC devices use the XU control index + 1 as the 
control selector value. For that reason newer driver versions will not require 
applications to use the UVCIOC_CTRL_ADD ioctl anymore.

> 4. If 3 is correct, when sending the first xu control via ioctl, what

The control selector value (which is usually the XU control index + 1), the 
control size in bytes, and a pointer to a buffer that stores the control 
value.

> 5. How does one determine the size of an XU control?

The size can be retrieved from the device using the GET_LEN request. That's 
what newer driver versions will do (likely in 2.6.39). The other way is to get 
it from the vendor documentation.

No worries.

Did UVC_QUIRK_STREAM_NO_FID make any difference ?

The camera doesn't report exposure/auto exposure controls in its descriptors. 
You could hack the driver to make it think the camera supports those controls. 
You should then be able to set them from userspace to see if they make any 
difference.

The easiest way would be to modify uvc_ctrl_init_device() in uvc_ctrl.c. Add

static const u8 camera_controls[3] = { 0x0e, 0x00, 0x00 };

at the beginning of the function, and replace

                } else if (UVC_ENTITY_TYPE(entity) == UVC_ITT_CAMERA) {
                        bmControls = entity->camera.bmControls;
                        bControlSize = entity->camera.bControlSize;
                }

with

                } else if (UVC_ENTITY_TYPE(entity) == UVC_ITT_CAMERA) {
                        bmControls = camera_controls;
                        bControlSize = entity->camera.bControlSize;
                }

There's no API for that that I know of.

-28 is -ENOSPC, it seems to be a bandwidth issue.

	not working
Message-ID: <AANLkTimhvfbxy2hyq-D=o79t0+ZdALh_Wp3K+FnvrZ1x@mail.gmail.com>

Good morning,

I bought a webcam called XSwebcam of TravelPAC. This webcam didn't
worked. Do not worry, I have not directly posted a message to this mailing
list. In fact, In fact, I took a look at
http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/webcam. In addition, I found a discussion in
forum relative to this my webcam, titled:  Probl?me de Webcam, logiciel
EasyCam (Nouveau Topic)<http://forum.ubuntu-fr.org/viewtopic.php?pid=3153965>
 [unfortunately in french] and it was too long to follow (13 pages).
So, let me to explain my problem:
*My distribution:* Ubuntu 10.10
The name of my webcam given by that command *lsusb:*
*Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0ac8:0332 Z-Star Microelectronics Corp.*

According to the documentation of Ubuntu, I should begin by testing
the command *gstreamer-properties*.The result is as follows:

The video entry is:
* *modul (in french, it's greffon) *: Video for linux 2 (v4l2)
** peripheral*: Vega USB 2.0 Camera
* *pipeline*: v4l2src device=/dev/video0"
By clicking on the test button, *Nothing happens! No window has been opened
and no video has been displayed.*

The next step according to the ubuntu documentation is trying *cheese*. It
has been installed successfully and cheese displayed just a black image
continuously! Cheese returned 0 error message.

The next step according to the ubuntu documentation is trying
*camorama. *Things
do not go well. camorama is blocked while adjusting the window siwe.
camorama can be closed only by forcing it.

The next step according to the ubuntu documentation is trying *guvcviewer*.
It is well installed, 0 error message, black image displayed continuously.

At this step, the ubuntu forum asked me try these commands:

amine at amine-laptop:~$ dmesg | tail -20

Then, i run cheese in the terminal to catch any error message.


amine at amine-laptop:~$ cheese
amine at amine-laptop:~$


The Ubuntu forum told me that according to the results of the two showed no
error. The Ubuntu forum concluded that it could be possibly a driver bug.
That's why I sent this message to this mailing list.

Is there Any idea for solving this problem?

Thanks you.

Yes, but then application log is strange:

>libv4l2: error turning on stream: Device or resource busy
>VIDIOC_STREAMON - Unable to start capture: Device or resource busy

VIDIOC_STREAMON is returning EBUSY, I guess it should return ENOPC in this case.

Hi Laurent,

thank you for your attention,

I enclose as a file the output of "lsusb -v -d 2232:1001" (a bit long).

There are nothing (in the execution of my program) printed in 
"/var/log/messages/".
Also, the command "dmesg" gives no additional information ( I run it 
before executing my program and after it).  (anyway, I copy the last 
lines of dmesg) output:

[ 2909.989414] tun0: Disabled Privacy Extensions
[ 2910.281249] nf_conntrack version 0.5.0 (16384 buckets, 65536 max)
[ 2910.281749] CONFIG_NF_CT_ACCT is deprecated and will be removed soon. 
Please use
[ 2910.281752] nf_conntrack.acct=1 kernel parameter, acct=1 nf_conntrack 
module option or
[ 2910.281754] sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=1 to enable it.
[ 2928.462797] hda-intel: IRQ timing workaround is activated for card 
#0. Suggest a bigger bdl_pos_adj.


BTW, I also enclose the output of my program (called "isabel_video") 
with debug information activated (which prints all ioctls send to the 
driver). There is a pretty good bunch of information, but the last grab 
size change is at line 788 (you can see other previous changes searching 
for the "setGrabSize" string).

The schema is:
VIDIOC_STREAMOFF(mode=1)
VIDIOC_REQBUFS (count=0,type=1,memory=1)        # CARE HERE: I introduce 
it because some drivers requires to ask
                                                                                      # for zero buffer to release memory.
                                                                                      # I found this idea came in the "lucview" program
then, some VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES to poll for gram sizes (again),
VIDIOC_G_FMT      # get current values
VIDIOC_TRY_FMT  # sanity check
VIDIOC_S_FMT      # set the new values

finally,
VIDIOC_REQBUFS(count=2,type=1,memory=1)
VIDIOC_QUERYBUF(0, ...
VIDIOC_QBUF(0, ...
VIDIOC_QUERYBUF(1,...
VIDIOC_QBUF(1,...
VIDIOC_STREAMON(mode=1)

and no further evolution... Note that all ioctl return value >= 0 (are ok).

Should you need any further information, or something I can do at my 
laptop, just ask for it ,

Thank you very much,

Gabriel Huecas

a MSI Wind U135DX netbook).

Here's the output of the above command:

Hello.  I just found out that in Linux, using XU commands currently requires
root permissions.  I have read a decent amount regarding XU usage in Linux
and I have not stumbled across this yet.  Do you have any more information
regarding this situation and when it may be corrected?  I wasted a
significant amount of time looking at raw USB wire traffic before a vendor
mentioned this to me.  Thank you.

Brent Weatherall.

Associate the H.264 GUID with an H.264 pixel format so that frame
and stream based format descriptors with this GUID are recognized
by the UVC video driver.

Parse the UVC 1.0 and UVC 1.1 VS_FORMAT_MPEG2TS descriptors.
This a stream based format, so we generate a dummy frame descriptor
with a dummy frame interval range.

You may want to follow linux-media, as UVC patches seem to be posted
there.

I believe your issue is already fixed by commit
8fb91b33c6bfa3ac5e4ad76920b7bcd7bdbbb6d0
"uvcvideo: Remove sysadmin requirements for UVCIOC_CTRL_MAP"
which was merged into the mainline kernel between 2.6.36 and 2.6.37-rc1.
