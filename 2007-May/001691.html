</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Isochronous buffers are allocated using dwMaxVideoFrameSize, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is clearly a bug. I'm working on a fix.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The stack trace you posted shows your device uses bulk transfers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could you tell me how big dwMaxPayloadTransferSize is ? If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devices insists on using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; huge buffers, there's not much I can do about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I simply wouldn't allocate that much memory for the urbs, this way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to work reliable with the driver I have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I added some debug at the allocation it is 2.7 MB/URB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I suspect that the dwMaxPayloadTransferSize value is thus equal to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2752512 as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For bulk transfers, you are right, I could allocate smaller URBs. As
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bulk transfers are guaranteed, I can split payloads across multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; URBs. For isochronous transfers that won't be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is also possible for isochronous transfers, if the framebuffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't get fully filled just drop the frame. By experience this works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very well with em28xx based devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After having a closer look at the spec, isochronous transfers won't be an
</I>&gt;<i> issue. Each isochronous packet starts with a UVC header. I already submit
</I>&gt;<i> isochronous URBs of no more than 40 packets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For bulk transfers, the situation seems a little more complex than I
</I>&gt;<i> thought. Bulk payloads can be made of lots of packets, up to a whole frame
</I>&gt;<i> per payload. The maximum payload size is reported by the device. As the
</I>&gt;<i> device sends a header for each payload and not for each URB, I have to find
</I>&gt;<i> a way detect payload boundaries (keep in mind that payloads can have a
</I>&gt;<i> variable size).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When using payload-sized URBs, each URB will contain a single payload. This
</I>&gt;<i> is what the Linux UVC driver currently does, and it works fine as long as
</I>&gt;<i> the device doesn't have a payload size bigger than what the host can
</I>&gt;<i> allocate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When splitting payloads across multiple URBs, I need another way to detect
</I>&gt;<i> payload boundaries. As the payload size isn't known in advance (only the
</I>&gt;<i> maximum size is known), I can't rely on a byte count. A possible solution
</I>&gt;<i> would have been to detect URBs with an actual length smaller than the
</I>&gt;<i> transfer buffer length, as such URBs should indicate the end of a payload.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, this won't work as the payload size can be an exact multiple
</I>&gt;<i> of the URB size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you think of a way to detect payload boundaries properly when splitting
</I>&gt;<i> payloads across multiple URBs ?
</I>
Maybe I overlooked the problem. The device will send a zero-byte data packet 
to indicate the end of the payload. I somehow thought this wouldn't show in 
the URBs, but I'm not so sure about it. I know Linux will use the zero-byte 
data packet to detect the end of the bulk transfer, but will the USB stack 
return a zero-sized URB if the bulk transfer ends on a URB boundary ? I can't 
test that on the bulk device I have, as its payload size is not a multiple of 
the bulk packet size.
