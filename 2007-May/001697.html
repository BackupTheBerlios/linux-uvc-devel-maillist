</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The stack trace you posted shows your device uses bulk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transfers. Could you tell me how big dwMaxPayloadTransferSize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is ? If the devices insists on using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; huge buffers, there's not much I can do about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I simply wouldn't allocate that much memory for the urbs, this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way seems to work reliable with the driver I have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I added some debug at the allocation it is 2.7 MB/URB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect that the dwMaxPayloadTransferSize value is thus equal to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2752512 as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For bulk transfers, you are right, I could allocate smaller URBs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As bulk transfers are guaranteed, I can split payloads across
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; multiple URBs. For isochronous transfers that won't be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it is also possible for isochronous transfers, if the framebuffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't get fully filled just drop the frame. By experience this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; works very well with em28xx based devices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; After having a closer look at the spec, isochronous transfers won't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; an issue. Each isochronous packet starts with a UVC header. I already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; submit isochronous URBs of no more than 40 packets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For bulk transfers, the situation seems a little more complex than I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thought. Bulk payloads can be made of lots of packets, up to a whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; frame per payload. The maximum payload size is reported by the device.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As the device sends a header for each payload and not for each URB, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a way detect payload boundaries (keep in mind that payloads can have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; variable size).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; When using payload-sized URBs, each URB will contain a single payload.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is what the Linux UVC driver currently does, and it works fine as long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; as the device doesn't have a payload size bigger than what the host can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; allocate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; When splitting payloads across multiple URBs, I need another way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; detect payload boundaries. As the payload size isn't known in advance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (only the maximum size is known), I can't rely on a byte count. A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; possible solution would have been to detect URBs with an actual length
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; smaller than the transfer buffer length, as such URBs should indicate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the end of a payload. Unfortunately, this won't work as the payload
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; size can be an exact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of the URB size.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Can you think of a way to detect payload boundaries properly when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; splitting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; payloads across multiple URBs ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe I overlooked the problem. The device will send a zero-byte data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packet to indicate the end of the payload. I somehow thought this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wouldn't show in the URBs, but I'm not so sure about it. I know Linux
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will use the zero-byte data packet to detect the end of the bulk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer, but will the USB stack return a zero-sized URB if the bulk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer ends on a URB boundary ? I can't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; test that on the bulk device I have, as its payload size is not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the bulk packet size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If possible if you redo that part, please try to reuse the code of the
</I>&gt;<i> data transfer code of the em28xx (or at least consider a similar way)
</I>&gt;<i> so that we can merge that codepart.
</I>
Or you could try to reuse the uvcvideo code in em28xx (or at least consider a 
similar way) so that we can merge that codepart.

Seriously speaking, apart from the isochronous allocation code which is 
already very similar to the uvcvideo code, I don't see much data transfer 
code in the em28xx driver that I could reuse.

I'm also trying to solve issues with bulk transfers that the em28xx driver 
doesn't have to support.

&gt;<i> I defined the boundaries by looking at the packet size, there was no
</I>&gt;<i> packet which had the length 0, since I had to do a fast solution I
</I>&gt;<i> just looked at the packet size which was smaller than the average
</I>&gt;<i> packets, this indicated a new frame for me.
</I>
I don't like heuristics. This is certainly not a proper solution. Either all 
URBs except the last one are full (with possibly a zero sized URB if the 
payload size is a multiple of the URB size), or they are not. According to 
the USB 2.0 specification this should be the case. I'll test this on the only 
bulk device I own.

&gt;<i> However this doesn't work well with 176x144 the driver cuts around 20
</I>&gt;<i> lines ontop of the video.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll also have a closer look at it tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the specs every frame should start with some frameheaders.
</I>
Every payload starts with a payload header. This is why I need a reliable way 
to detect payload boundaries.
