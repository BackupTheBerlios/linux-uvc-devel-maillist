</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the specs every frame should start with some frameheaders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Every payload starts with a payload header. This is why I need a reliable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; way to detect payload boundaries.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand why you need to know this.  The USB host controller
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will handle the zero length packets for you, if needed, and it will also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; divide up your bulk urb into the proper sizes for you, depending on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware size of the endpoint.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And you also already know the size of the bulk endpoint in your driver,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if you want to restrict your urb size to that, however, for decent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; speeds, I would not recommend doing this, but instead, letting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware divide up the urb for you into smaller pieces, filling the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hardware pipeline up properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue here is memory usage. The device which triggered all this discussion
</I>&gt;<i> is a webcam using bulk payloads of 2.7MB, which is quite a lot for memory
</I>&gt;<i> constrained hosts. Instead of submitting a 2.7MB URB which would then be
</I>&gt;<i> divided in 512 bytes packets by the USB host controller, Markus adviced to
</I>&gt;<i> use smaller URBs (a few tens or hundreds of kilobytes). Those URBs would also
</I>&gt;<i> be divided in 512 bytes packets by the USB host controller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When submitting URBs smaller than the maximum payload size, the problem that
</I>&gt;<i> arises is that I need a way to detect payload boundaries. This was easy with
</I>&gt;<i> payload-sized URBs, as a complete payload would be containted in a single
</I>&gt;<i> URB, but becomes a bit more complex for smaller URBs. If the payload actual
</I>&gt;<i> size (which can be smaller than the payload maximum size reported by the
</I>&gt;<i> device for variable size payloads) is not a multiple of the URB size, the
</I>&gt;<i> last URB of a payload will have a smaller size. In the other case, I was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if the driver we would receive an empty URB at the end of the
</I>&gt;<i> payload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that drivers usually submit URBs big enough to contain a single
</I>&gt;<i> payload. However, with this buggy device, the payload size is too big for
</I>&gt;<i> some memory constrained hosts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think the device should be considered broken in that it does require
</I>&gt;<i> lots of memory, or is the &quot;split bulk URB&quot; approach viable ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hi Laurent,

I wouldn't consider it as broken since that device works with vmware
in windows, any time.
As far as I captured the usbbus in windows the Urbs are also smaller in windows.
The 2.7 MB constraint is a result of 1280x1024x2 (YUY2), so the
payload would be 2.7 MB according to how it was done initially.
Even though, the requested videosize in any case was 176x144x2, so
only 50688 bytes would effectivly be used.
The 2.7 mb constraint was read from the uvc config space, so there's
very likely a way to do it right by allocating NR packets * max packet
size for each urb. MS uvc driver works with that device in USB 1.1 and
USB 2.0 mode, where USB 1.1 introduces mjpeg interfaces.

(beside that I haven't tested the latest patch yet, but will do today)

thanks,
Markus
