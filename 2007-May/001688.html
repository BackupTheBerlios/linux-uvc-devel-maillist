</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isochronous transfers that won't be possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it is also possible for isochronous transfers, if the framebuffer

</I>&gt;<i> well with em28xx based devices. 
</I>
After having a closer look at the spec, isochronous transfers won't be an 
issue. Each isochronous packet starts with a UVC header. I already submit 
isochronous URBs of no more than 40 packets.

For bulk transfers, the situation seems a little more complex than I thought. 
Bulk payloads can be made of lots of packets, up to a whole frame per 
payload. The maximum payload size is reported by the device. As the device 
sends a header for each payload and not for each URB, I have to find a way 
detect payload boundaries (keep in mind that payloads can have a variable 
size).

When using payload-sized URBs, each URB will contain a single payload. This is 
what the Linux UVC driver currently does, and it works fine as long as the 
device doesn't have a payload size bigger than what the host can allocate.

When splitting payloads across multiple URBs, I need another way to detect 
payload boundaries. As the payload size isn't known in advance (only the 
maximum size is known), I can't rely on a byte count. A possible solution 
would have been to detect URBs with an actual length smaller than the 
transfer buffer length, as such URBs should indicate the end of a payload. 
Unfortunately, this won't work as the payload size can be an exact multiple 
of the URB size.

Can you think of a way to detect payload boundaries properly when splitting 
payloads across multiple URBs ?
