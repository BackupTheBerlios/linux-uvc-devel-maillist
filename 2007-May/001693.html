</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Isochronous buffers are allocated using dwMaxVideoFrameSize, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is clearly a bug. I'm working on a fix.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The stack trace you posted shows your device uses bulk transfers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could you tell me how big dwMaxPayloadTransferSize is ? If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devices insists on using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; huge buffers, there's not much I can do about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I simply wouldn't allocate that much memory for the urbs, this way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to work reliable with the driver I have.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I added some debug at the allocation it is 2.7 MB/URB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect that the dwMaxPayloadTransferSize value is thus equal to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 2752512 as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; For bulk transfers, you are right, I could allocate smaller URBs. As
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; bulk transfers are guaranteed, I can split payloads across multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; URBs. For isochronous transfers that won't be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it is also possible for isochronous transfers, if the framebuffer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't get fully filled just drop the frame. By experience this works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; very well with em28xx based devices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After having a closer look at the spec, isochronous transfers won't be an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue. Each isochronous packet starts with a UVC header. I already submit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isochronous URBs of no more than 40 packets.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For bulk transfers, the situation seems a little more complex than I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought. Bulk payloads can be made of lots of packets, up to a whole frame
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; per payload. The maximum payload size is reported by the device. As the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device sends a header for each payload and not for each URB, I have to
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a way detect payload boundaries (keep in mind that payloads can have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variable size).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When using payload-sized URBs, each URB will contain a single payload.
</I>&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is what the Linux UVC driver currently does, and it works fine as long as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the device doesn't have a payload size bigger than what the host can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When splitting payloads across multiple URBs, I need another way to detect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payload boundaries. As the payload size isn't known in advance (only the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maximum size is known), I can't rely on a byte count. A possible solution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have been to detect URBs with an actual length smaller than the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer buffer length, as such URBs should indicate the end of a payload.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately, this won't work as the payload size can be an exact
</I>&gt;<i> multiple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the URB size.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you think of a way to detect payload boundaries properly when
</I>&gt;<i> splitting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payloads across multiple URBs ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I overlooked the problem. The device will send a zero-byte data packet
</I>&gt;<i> to indicate the end of the payload. I somehow thought this wouldn't show in
</I>&gt;<i> the URBs, but I'm not so sure about it. I know Linux will use the zero-byte
</I>&gt;<i> data packet to detect the end of the bulk transfer, but will the USB stack
</I>&gt;<i> return a zero-sized URB if the bulk transfer ends on a URB boundary ? I
</I>&gt;<i> can't
</I>&gt;<i> test that on the bulk device I have, as its payload size is not a multiple
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> the bulk packet size.
</I>
If possible if you redo that part, please try to reuse the code of the
data transfer code of the em28xx (or at least consider a similar way)
so that we can merge that codepart.

I defined the boundaries by looking at the packet size, there was no
packet which had the length 0, since I had to do a fast solution I
just looked at the packet size which was smaller than the average
packets, this indicated a new frame for me.
However this doesn't work well with 176x144 the driver cuts around 20
lines ontop of the video.
I'll also have a closer look at it tomorrow.
Regarding the specs every frame should start with some frameheaders.
