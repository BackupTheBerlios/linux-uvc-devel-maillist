</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'll also have a closer look at it tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the specs every frame should start with some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frameheaders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Every payload starts with a payload header. This is why I need a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; reliable way to detect payload boundaries.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I don't understand why you need to know this.  The USB host controller
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; will handle the zero length packets for you, if needed, and it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; also divide up your bulk urb into the proper sizes for you, depending
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; on the hardware size of the endpoint.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And you also already know the size of the bulk endpoint in your driver,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if you want to restrict your urb size to that, however, for decent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; speeds, I would not recommend doing this, but instead, letting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hardware divide up the urb for you into smaller pieces, filling the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hardware pipeline up properly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The issue here is memory usage. The device which triggered all this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion is a webcam using bulk payloads of 2.7MB, which is quite a lot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for memory constrained hosts. Instead of submitting a 2.7MB URB which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would then be divided in 512 bytes packets by the USB host controller,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Markus adviced to use smaller URBs (a few tens or hundreds of kilobytes).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Those URBs would also be divided in 512 bytes packets by the USB host
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controller.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When submitting URBs smaller than the maximum payload size, the problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that arises is that I need a way to detect payload boundaries. This was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easy with payload-sized URBs, as a complete payload would be containted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a single URB, but becomes a bit more complex for smaller URBs. If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payload actual size (which can be smaller than the payload maximum size
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reported by the device for variable size payloads) is not a multiple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the URB size, the last URB of a payload will have a smaller size. In the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other case, I was wondering if the driver we would receive an empty URB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the end of the payload.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know that drivers usually submit URBs big enough to contain a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payload. However, with this buggy device, the payload size is too big for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some memory constrained hosts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you think the device should be considered broken in that it does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require lots of memory, or is the &quot;split bulk URB&quot; approach viable ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Laurent,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't consider it as broken since that device works with vmware
</I>&gt;<i> in windows, any time.
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I captured the usbbus in windows the Urbs are also smaller in
</I>&gt;<i> windows. The 2.7 MB constraint is a result of 1280x1024x2 (YUY2), so the
</I>&gt;<i> payload would be 2.7 MB according to how it was done initially.
</I>
It doesn't have to be. I have a bulk camera which supports 1280x1024 images in 
YUY2 format with 160kB payloads. The video frame is just divided in several 
payloads, each of them starting with a header.

&gt;<i> Even though, the requested videosize in any case was 176x144x2, so
</I>&gt;<i> only 50688 bytes would effectivly be used.
</I>&gt;<i> The 2.7 mb constraint was read from the uvc config space, so there's
</I>&gt;<i> very likely a way to do it right by allocating NR packets * max packet
</I>&gt;<i> size for each urb. MS uvc driver works with that device in USB 1.1 and
</I>&gt;<i> USB 2.0 mode, where USB 1.1 introduces mjpeg interfaces.
</I>
I don't know what the Windows driver does, so I can't really comment on that.

My point is that the device developers have overlooked the payload size issue. 
They should have used smaller payloads. This is why the device is 
bad/buggy/whatever we want to call this. Now, if the Linux USB stack should 
support split bulk transfers to work around those kind of devices is another 
issue. This is possible in the Linux UVC driver as long as the USB stack 
returns a &quot;short (or zero) URB&quot; at the end of the payload, much like the USB 
device returns a short (or zero) packet. Short URBs seem not to be an issue, 
but &quot;zero URBs&quot; might be.

&gt;<i> (beside that I haven't tested the latest patch yet, but will do today)
</I>
Let me know how it works.
