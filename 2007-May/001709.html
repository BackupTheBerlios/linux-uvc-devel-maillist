</I>
The issue here is memory usage. The device which triggered all this discussion 
is a webcam using bulk payloads of 2.7MB, which is quite a lot for memory 
constrained hosts. Instead of submitting a 2.7MB URB which would then be 
divided in 512 bytes packets by the USB host controller, Markus adviced to 
use smaller URBs (a few tens or hundreds of kilobytes). Those URBs would also 
be divided in 512 bytes packets by the USB host controller.

When submitting URBs smaller than the maximum payload size, the problem that 
arises is that I need a way to detect payload boundaries. This was easy with 
payload-sized URBs, as a complete payload would be containted in a single 
URB, but becomes a bit more complex for smaller URBs. If the payload actual 
size (which can be smaller than the payload maximum size reported by the 
device for variable size payloads) is not a multiple of the URB size, the 
last URB of a payload will have a smaller size. In the other case, I was 
wondering if the driver we would receive an empty URB at the end of the 
payload.

I know that drivers usually submit URBs big enough to contain a single 
payload. However, with this buggy device, the payload size is too big for 
some memory constrained hosts.

Do you think the device should be considered broken in that it does require 
lots of memory, or is the &quot;split bulk URB&quot; approach viable ?

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
