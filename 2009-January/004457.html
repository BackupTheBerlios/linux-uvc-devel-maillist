<PRE>Hi,

I've noticed that the URB size in case of Bulk transport is set to the
maximum payload size, or to a limit that is a multiple of the bulk
packet size (psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS). The rationale behind this is
'to be consistent with isochronous mode'.

We encounter some difficulties with this approach. These occur when
operating Bulk transport over a full-speed link. In that case, the limit
becomes 64 * 40 = 2560 bytes per URB. The device we use has 16KB
payloads. The frames typically do not consist of an exact multiple of
16KB, so a frame is send as a sequence of 16KB USB bulk transfers,
ending with a bulk transfer &lt; 16KB.

According to the USB 2.0 specification a bulk transfer is considered
done when:

1) the expected amount of data has been transferred
2) a short packet (or zero-length packet) has been transferred

For the device, each of the transfers used to sent full sized payloads
fall in category 1. 16KB is to be expected by the host, as this is the
MaxPayloadSize (signalled in the configuration descriptor).

The device is unaware of the fact that hosts using the UVC driver split
payload transfers over multiple bulk transfers. If the payload buffer
size is not an exact multiple of the URB size determined by the UVC
driver, the host will not be able to detect the end of a payload
reliably.

Example:

Assume the frame to be transferred is 100KB. The maximum payload size is
16KB. The device will submit 6 16KB payloads and a 4KB final payload.

Because the first 16 KB payload transfers are of category 1, the device
will not insert a ZLP between the last packet of a payload and the first
packet of the next payload. The final payload is 4KB, which is a
multiple of a bulk packet (at either full or high speed), so the device
will end this payload transfer with a ZLP.

At high speed the UVC driver will issue URBs of 16KB as the limit set by
psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS in that case is 512*40 = 20KB. Each of the
16KB payloads is reliably detected because the USB buffer is completely
full.

The URB transfers reliably detects the bulk transfer end because of the
ZLP.

At full speed, the UVC driver will submit URBs of 2650 bytes. This means
that the first 16 KB payload will result in 6 URBS completely filled,
but the 7th URB will fail to detect the boundary between the two 16KB
payloads. It will continue to fill the URB until the URB buffer is full
resulting in an URB that has 1024 bytes of the first payload and 1536
bytes of the next payload (including its payload header).

This case is not handled in the bulk data decoder I think.

It may seem that ensuring that the payload size is an multiple of the
URB size might solve this issue. For full sized payloads that is indeed
the case. Each full sized payload then results in a multiple URBs that
only contain data for that payload. However, if the last payload
contains less data than a full sized payload, the device inserts a ZLP
if the last packet was not short. This because from the device point of
view, it needs to signal that the host is going to get less data than it
expects. However, it may happen that the bulk transfer ends at an exact
multiple of the URB size.

Again, example:

100 KB frame, 16KB max payload and 2K URB size. The first 6 payload
transfers all work well. Each payload is transferred with 8 URBs, and
payload boundaries are detected based on payload buffer being full.

The 7th payload is 4 KB in size. An exact multiple of bulk packets
completes this transfer, and because 4 KB &lt; 16KB, the device inserts a
ZLP. The host receives 2 URBs, and then an URB of 0 bytes long (=ZLP).
Normally, that ZLP would have been absorbed by the USB transport layer
and caused the URB to end 'prematurely'. But because the UVC host now
uses a smaller URB buffer lenghth, it needs to handle these ZLP as
0-length URBs.

It seems that this is indeed the case, and that 0 length URB would mark
the end of the payload. So this may be a fix:

In static int uvc_init_video_bulk(struct uvc_video_device *video,
	struct usb_host_endpoint *ep, gfp_t gfp_flags) (uvc_video.c)

	psize = le16_to_cpu(ep-&gt;desc.wMaxPacketSize) &amp; 0x07ff;
	size = video-&gt;streaming-&gt;ctrl.dwMaxPayloadTransferSize;
	video-&gt;bulk.max_payload_size = size;
-	if (size &gt; psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS)
-		size = psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS;
+ 	if (size &gt; psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS) {
+		size = psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS;
+		size -= video-&gt;bulk.max_payload_size % size;
+	}
	if (uvc_alloc_urb_buffers(video, size) &lt; 0)

I welcome a discussion about this, and a more detailed rationale behind
the use of UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS in this context. Especially since for
full speed, the packet size difference between bulk and iso transport
can differ significantly - 64 versus max. 1023. This results in bulk URB
sizes that are up to 16 times smaller than the ones used for isochronous
transfer.
