Thanks, i'll try it.

I have another, more general question: It seems that there are different
ways to activate a uvcvideo cam? For instance, when i have a device
already open (eg: kaffeine, watching my favorite TV-Program) and than
starting &quot;ekiga&quot;, the video playback stopped for a few seconds and then 
goes on, when the uvc cam is ready. This is really annoying. Especially
for &quot;ekiga&quot;, while it does it on every video call (This happens too,
when i manually load the additional motor controls for this cam.)

I notice, that &quot;motion&quot; doesn't shows up such behavior when activating
the cam or loading the motor controls. A current playing video is not
interrupted. That's really nice. :-)

Is it possible to have this for ekiga and other apps, too? Is this a job
for uvcvideo or more a job the application side?

btw: Is it planned to have &quot;build-in&quot; support in uvcvideo for the
various motor controls (like motion) or is it possible (maybe for
me ;-)) to make my own version especially for my Sphere AF?
Maybe i look in the wrong direction? ;-)

Sorry for bad English, i hope you cache my problem(s).

Thank you!

Stefan
