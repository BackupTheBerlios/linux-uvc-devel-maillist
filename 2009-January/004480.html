<PRE>Dear UVC Developers,

[Sorry for the second message, the earlier message was an HTML
formatted message, sorry!]

I am working on developing a UVC camera. The camera itself runs linux kernel
and uses the gadget mode. We have a gadget driver written and an application
running on the device, which pushes data over USB to the host when host
requests data. The camera works in Isochronous mode and copies 1024 bytes
every microframe.

With a bit of effort (which mostly involved correcting some of the
descriptor values on the device side), I could get uvcvideo driver on the
host to work with the camera. luvcview works fine, so is a simpe gstreamer
viewer which uses the v4l2src element.

We would like to get the camera working well with the uvcvideo and is
completely standards compliant.

Below are some of the issues observed, I would appreciate any tips to debug
the issue.

The kernel message on the host says that the the uvcvideo invokes quirks=1.

kernel: [88819.299222] uvcvideo: Forcing device quirks 0x1 by module
parameter for testing purpose.
kernel: [88819.299227] uvcvideo: Please report required quirks to the
linux-uvc-devel mailing list.

I am wondering why quirks was turned on to a value of 1 and see what can be
done at the device side to fix it.

I am using gstreamer to stream from the camera and display the frames. with
the pipeline arranged as follows.

  gst-launch v4l2src ! jpegdec ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink

I see that the gstreamer quits after streaming for afew hours saying that
there is an error in the JPEG stream. It looks like some corruption is
happening to the JPEG frames inside the camera. But I see no USB messages on
the host or the device. To narrow down the problem, we have an application
which takes  one JPEG image and keep streaming them continuously, instead of
using the ones from the camera. This probably will validate the USB data
path.

It will be great if uvc developers can throw some light on how to debug
these issues.

regards
John
