<PRE>Hi Robert,

sorry for the late reply.

To be honest, the real reason is that I had to set a limit and that value 
wasn't really worse than another (at least at that time) :-)

&gt;<i> We encounter some difficulties with this approach. These occur when

</I>&gt;<i> payloads. The frames typically do not consist of an exact multiple of
</I>&gt;<i> 16KB, so a frame is send as a sequence of 16KB USB bulk transfers,
</I>&gt;<i> ending with a bulk transfer &lt; 16KB.
</I>
It's really unfortunate that the USB 2.0 and UVC 1.1 specifications use the 
term &quot;payload&quot; for two different concepts.

In USB 2.0, a payload is the data that is carried in the data field of a data 
packet within a bus transaction. In UVC 1.1, a Payload Transfer is a unit of 
data transfer common to bulk and isochronous endpoints.

Your device has 16kB &quot;payloads&quot;. As bulk payloads can be 512 bytes long at 
most (in high-speed) mode, I assume you mean UVC payloads (a UVC header 
followed by frame data). Is that correct ?

In that case, every 16kB UVC payload should be terminated by a short packet, 
not only the last payload.

&gt;<i> According to the USB 2.0 specification a bulk transfer is considered
</I>&gt;<i> done when:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) the expected amount of data has been transferred
</I>&gt;<i> 2) a short packet (or zero-length packet) has been transferred
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the device, each of the transfers used to sent full sized payloads
</I>&gt;<i> fall in category 1. 16KB is to be expected by the host, as this is the
</I>&gt;<i> MaxPayloadSize (signalled in the configuration descriptor).
</I>
You're mixing USB payloads and UVC payloads. A UVC payload is transferred in a 
single bulk transfer, made of multiple bulk data transactions, each carrying 
a USB payload. The last data packet of every bulk transfer should be a short 
(or zero) packet.

If your device sends 16kB UVC payloads, it should terminate each of them with 
a short bulk data packet.

&gt;<i> The device is unaware of the fact that hosts using the UVC driver split
</I>&gt;<i> payload transfers over multiple bulk transfers. If the payload buffer
</I>&gt;<i> size is not an exact multiple of the URB size determined by the UVC
</I>&gt;<i> driver, the host will not be able to detect the end of a payload
</I>&gt;<i> reliably.
</I>
The device is unaware of how the host splits a UVC payload across multiple 
URBs, but it's aware of how a UVC payload is split across bulk payloads.

&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Assume the frame to be transferred is 100KB. The maximum payload size is
</I>&gt;<i> 16KB. The device will submit 6 16KB payloads and a 4KB final payload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because the first 16 KB payload transfers are of category 1, the device
</I>&gt;<i> will not insert a ZLP between the last packet of a payload and the first
</I>&gt;<i> packet of the next payload. The final payload is 4KB, which is a
</I>&gt;<i> multiple of a bulk packet (at either full or high speed), so the device
</I>&gt;<i> will end this payload transfer with a ZLP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At high speed the UVC driver will issue URBs of 16KB as the limit set by
</I>&gt;<i> psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS in that case is 512*40 = 20KB. Each of the
</I>&gt;<i> 16KB payloads is reliably detected because the USB buffer is completely
</I>&gt;<i> full.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The URB transfers reliably detects the bulk transfer end because of the
</I>&gt;<i> ZLP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At full speed, the UVC driver will submit URBs of 2650 bytes. This means
</I>&gt;<i> that the first 16 KB payload will result in 6 URBS completely filled,
</I>&gt;<i> but the 7th URB will fail to detect the boundary between the two 16KB
</I>&gt;<i> payloads. It will continue to fill the URB until the URB buffer is full
</I>&gt;<i> resulting in an URB that has 1024 bytes of the first payload and 1536
</I>&gt;<i> bytes of the next payload (including its payload header).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This case is not handled in the bulk data decoder I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may seem that ensuring that the payload size is an multiple of the
</I>&gt;<i> URB size might solve this issue. For full sized payloads that is indeed
</I>&gt;<i> the case. Each full sized payload then results in a multiple URBs that
</I>&gt;<i> only contain data for that payload. However, if the last payload
</I>&gt;<i> contains less data than a full sized payload, the device inserts a ZLP
</I>&gt;<i> if the last packet was not short. This because from the device point of
</I>&gt;<i> view, it needs to signal that the host is going to get less data than it
</I>&gt;<i> expects. However, it may happen that the bulk transfer ends at an exact
</I>&gt;<i> multiple of the URB size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 100 KB frame, 16KB max payload and 2K URB size. The first 6 payload
</I>&gt;<i> transfers all work well. Each payload is transferred with 8 URBs, and
</I>&gt;<i> payload boundaries are detected based on payload buffer being full.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 7th payload is 4 KB in size. An exact multiple of bulk packets
</I>&gt;<i> completes this transfer, and because 4 KB &lt; 16KB, the device inserts a
</I>&gt;<i> ZLP. The host receives 2 URBs, and then an URB of 0 bytes long (=ZLP).
</I>&gt;<i> Normally, that ZLP would have been absorbed by the USB transport layer
</I>&gt;<i> and caused the URB to end 'prematurely'. But because the UVC host now
</I>&gt;<i> uses a smaller URB buffer lenghth, it needs to handle these ZLP as
</I>&gt;<i> 0-length URBs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that this is indeed the case, and that 0 length URB would mark
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the payload. So this may be a fix:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In static int uvc_init_video_bulk(struct uvc_video_device *video,
</I>&gt;<i> 	struct usb_host_endpoint *ep, gfp_t gfp_flags) (uvc_video.c)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	psize = le16_to_cpu(ep-&gt;desc.wMaxPacketSize) &amp; 0x07ff;
</I>&gt;<i> 	size = video-&gt;streaming-&gt;ctrl.dwMaxPayloadTransferSize;
</I>&gt;<i> 	video-&gt;bulk.max_payload_size = size;
</I>&gt;<i> -	if (size &gt; psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS)
</I>&gt;<i> -		size = psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS;
</I>&gt;<i> + 	if (size &gt; psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS) {
</I>&gt;<i> +		size = psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS;
</I>&gt;<i> +		size -= video-&gt;bulk.max_payload_size % size;
</I>&gt;<i> +	}
</I>&gt;<i> 	if (uvc_alloc_urb_buffers(video, size) &lt; 0)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I welcome a discussion about this, and a more detailed rationale behind
</I>&gt;<i> the use of UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS in this context. Especially since for
</I>&gt;<i> full speed, the packet size difference between bulk and iso transport
</I>&gt;<i> can differ significantly - 64 versus max. 1023. This results in bulk URB
</I>&gt;<i> sizes that are up to 16 times smaller than the ones used for isochronous
</I>&gt;<i> transfer.
</I>
Let's first discuss the above confusion between USB and UVC payloads. If it 
turns our I was wrong, I'll analyse your patch :-)

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
