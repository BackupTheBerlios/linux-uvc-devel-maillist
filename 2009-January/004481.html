<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've noticed that the URB size in case of Bulk transport is set to
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; maximum payload size, or to a limit that is a multiple of the bulk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packet size (psize * UVC_MAX_ISO_PACKETS). The rationale behind this
</I>is
&gt;<i> &gt; 'to be consistent with isochronous mode'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, the real reason is that I had to set a limit and that 
</I>&gt;<i> value wasn't really worse than another (at least at that time) :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We encounter some difficulties with this approach. These occur when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operating Bulk transport over a full-speed link. In that case, the
</I>limit
&gt;<i> &gt; becomes 64 * 40 = 2560 bytes per URB. The device we use has 16KB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; payloads. The frames typically do not consist of an exact multiple
</I>of
&gt;<i> &gt; 16KB, so a frame is send as a sequence of 16KB USB bulk transfers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ending with a bulk transfer &lt; 16KB.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's really unfortunate that the USB 2.0 and UVC 1.1 specifications
</I>use 
&gt;<i> &gt; the term &quot;payload&quot; for two different concepts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In USB 2.0, a payload is the data that is carried in the data field of
</I>a 
&gt;<i> data packet within a bus transaction. In UVC 1.1, a Payload Transfer
</I>is a &gt; unit of data transfer common to bulk and isochronous endpoints.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your device has 16kB &quot;payloads&quot;. As bulk payloads can be 512 bytes
</I>long at 
&gt;<i> most (in high-speed) mode, I assume you mean UVC payloads (a UVC
</I>header 
&gt;<i> followed by frame data). Is that correct ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, every 16kB UVC payload should be terminated by a short 
</I>&gt;<i> packet, not only the last payload.
</I>...

&gt;<i> Let's first discuss the above confusion between USB and UVC payloads. 
</I>&gt;<i> If it turns our I was wrong, I'll analyse your patch :-)
</I>
I did not know about the USB 2.0 terminology (payload == data in a
transaction packet), now I do. My references to 'payload' are always to
the UVC payload term.

My main confusion is on the situation where a frame is split in multiple
UVC payloads, all of them of maximum size except for the last. You are
stating that for those 'maximum sized' payloads (in our device's case:
16384 bytes) the device should insert a zero-length packet. We did some
experiments and if the device was made to insert a zero-length packet in
between two 'maximum sized' UVC payloads, we received three URB's in
uvc_video_decode_bulk():

[ 16384 ]  [0]  [ 16384 ]

There was one zero-length URB in between those two payload transfers.
Apparently, the USB host driver completes the URB based on its receive
buffer being full, before it handles the zero length packet. The next
URB then starts with a zero length packet and immediately completes with
0 bytes data received.

We wanted to figure out why this was happening, so we looked into the
USB 2.0 specification and saw those 'rules' about ending a USB bulk
transfer. We think the USB host implementation in Linux signals an URB
complete when it has gathered enough data to fill the URB receive
buffer. When the last full packet comes in, the URB is 'complete' as all
16384 bytes in its receive buffer are full. The hypothesis is that this
is done under the first clause of those Bulk transfer rules: if the
expected amount of data is received, the bulk transfer is complete.

We changed the behaviour of the device to only send zero length packets
in case of 'short' UVC payloads (shorter than the maximum payload size
signaled in the configuration descriptor) that end in a full bulk
packet. That worked without problems. 

The patch that I suggested has more to do with the limit on the payload
size that is imposed in the Bulk situation. Simply put, because of the
difference in maxium size of packets in Full speed (1023 in ISO, 64 in
Bulk), there is a huge difference in the computed payload buffer size.
For ISO, the buffer size is determined based on MAX_ISO_PACKETS * 1023
(potentially, if this is the size signaled by the device) while for
Bulk, this is MAX_ISO_PACKETS * 64.

We will repeat some experiments with the device sending ZLP in between
maximally sized UVC payloads using a USB bus analyser to verify these
findings. We'll post the results to this list.

Regards,

Robert Lukassen
