<PRE>Hi Chris,

please keep the list CC'ed.

No worries. My first tries aren't perfect either (I doubt any of my code could 
be considered perfect).

</I>
I don't mind whitespace cleanup patches, but please try to split them from the 
rest.

&gt;<i> Quick question on overlays - I assume these aren't planned as I don't see

</I>
If by overlay you mean writing to the graphic memory, you're right, this isn't 
planned. There is no way a USB device could write to the GPU, so this doesn't 
make sense.

&gt;<i> The Flash Player is a particularly awkward application in this regard -

</I>&gt;<i> the overlay for aspects of it's operation.
</I>
Really ? Should flash be added to the list of &quot;broken by design&quot; 
software ? :-)

&gt;<i> Although now I'm beginning to 
</I>&gt;<i> think a more logical approach might be to try and patch the flash support
</I>&gt;<i> library to work with the UVC driver and no overlay (but I'm not certain
</I>&gt;<i> that this is supported - even though there's example code available).
</I>
I'm not familiar with flash. Do they provide an open-source user library to 
access video devices ?

&gt;<i> The 
</I>&gt;<i> other advantage to this is that the xv_id comparisons in the v4l module for
</I>&gt;<i> xorg appear to get confused when they start by matching a YUYV against a
</I>&gt;<i> YUY2 but then compare the id's to find their not equal (my understanding is
</I>&gt;<i> that although not equal they are compatible?)
</I>
I don't think it makes sense to implement a &quot;software overlay&quot; in the kernel. 
It should definitely not be at the UVC driver level.

&gt;<i> On Wednesday 18 July 2007 20:52, you wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Start streaming the first time read() is called, not when the device is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opened. The queue should be allocated at the first read() call as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Don't hardcode the buffer count to 4, use the value set by VIDIOC_S_PARM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (with sensible limits).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As long as poll returns the correct results in this case it seems
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable. I was hoping you'd offer a better way to set the buffer count -
</I>&gt;<i> as I was struggling to know what to do.
</I>
The V4L2 specification isn't very clear about the number of buffers that 
should be allocated. Drivers are free to do as they want, VIDIOC_S_PARM is 
just a hint. You can either pre-allocate the number of buffers requested by 
VIDIOC_S_PARM, or allocate a single buffer when read() is called.

&gt;<i> &gt; This has nothing to do with read() support. VIDIOC_G_STD has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussed a lot in the v4l mailing list in the past, and I still believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it makes no sense for webcams.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't do this for read() - it was triggering what I couldn't decide if
</I>&gt;<i> was an application bug or a driver bug.  The V4L compat layer seems to rely
</I>&gt;<i> on this call returning a value other than -EINVAL.  Kopete (v4l app, but
</I>&gt;<i> v4l2 support looks like it's being added) was relying on the V4L compat
</I>&gt;<i> layer.  I didn't think it did any harm so I added it.
</I>
Again, I'd appreciate if you could split different features into separate 
patches :-)

The V4L2 specification doesn't make VIDIOC_G_STD mandatory, so I personally 
think the V4L compat layer, as well as applications, should be fixed to 
handle a lack of VIDIOC_G_STD.

&gt;<i> &gt; This won't work. read() can be called with data buffers smaller than a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video frame. You should not assume that a read() call will read a whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; buffer at once.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few of the other drivers do this, and I had made the assumption it was
</I>&gt;<i> correct from a statement made in the V4L spec.  Generally I agree with you
</I>&gt;<i> though - it should be possible to read parts of the buffer, and not the
</I>&gt;<i> whole buffer (and the V4L2 spec is not the V4L spec!)
</I>
Then I think those drivers are buggy. If I'm not mistaken, video-buf handles 
read() calls with buffer sizes smaller than the frame size. What made you 
assume that read() calls has to read a complete frame ?

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
