That's what I thought. Luckily that patch is quite widespread.

The tvtime packages are still being maintained by the distros'
packagers. Indeed, they're fixing stuff and porting from OSS to ALSA
mixers and the likes, so the program seems to be popular enough.

I don't know if you still need to centrally provide that patch. It's
not a bad idea, I guess. Apart from that, it's both in Mandriva and
OpenSuSE, and you can now find it in the RedHat/Fedora bug database:
<A HREF="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=655038">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=655038</A>
as I have taken the liberty to file a ticket.

Thanks,
Moritz
