Hi Laurent,

On one side, this is perhaps for the best.  It draws a hard line and
encourages app maintainers to update their API usage.  In a
forward-looking driver like uvcvideo, this can be quite powerful.
However, it works against the goal of inspiring confidence in folks
when they download the driver and try it out, and it creates more
support questions.  You've probably heard enough about camorama and
all the other apps in that category by now.  :-)

It's good to hear that the Motion developers spent some time on V4L2 support.

&gt;<i> uvcvideo already implements full buffer management. The streaming I/O V4L2
</I>&gt;<i> method is fully supported. I might consider using video-buf later, although
</I>&gt;<i> there are a few things I don't like in the API (especially the way video-buf

</I>&gt;<i> planned.
</I>
The latest SVN version of uvcvideo only appears to implement mmap().
Do you have this on a private branch?  It appears to mention that
read() is explicitly unsupported, and the user pointer I/O method
appears to be rejected in uvc_queue_buffer().  I won't argue that mmap
isn't the most important and that all apps should support mmap, but
not supporting read in uvcvideo will leave it incompatible with a few
apps.

&gt;<i> usbcam sounds interesting. Porting uvcvideo to usbcam would be lots of work,
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm not willing to do that for now. Feel free to give it a go though :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Don't forget that the uvcvideo driver is quite complex, and that it will

</I>&gt;<i> usbcam. You might have issues with control handling which is being rewritten
</I>&gt;<i> to allow for runtime controls definitions through specific ioctls. The
</I>&gt;<i> extended control API will also have to be implemented by usbcam, and the mini
</I>&gt;<i> drivers API will have to support control transactions.
</I>
I'm definitely pleased you don't pin it in the same category as usbvideo.  :-)

The control handling is on the list of things to rework.  ALSA seems
to have a reasonable interface with the snd_kcontrol.  It might also
be nice if the V4L2 API were expanded to support change notifications
like ALSA.

Regarding transactions, what did you have in mind?

I do like how uvcvideo does this stuff.  It seems a lot like how
jbd/reiserfs handle filesystem transactions, although those aren't
necessarily the best examples because they don't support undo.  It
also seems almost like overkill for uvcvideo, because it doesn't seem
to handle the case of a device rejecting a new control value, and
would be very hard to do this in a complete fashion anyway because of
the asynchronous notification method mandated by the spec.

Anyway, now it's time to reinvent the wheel yet again.  :-)  how about
this sort of interface for usbcam.  We create a new usbcam_txn
structure for the transaction handle, which has a list_head and maybe
some minidriver-specific state.  The minidriver gets new operations:

	int (*ctrl_txn_start)(struct usbcam_dev *udp, struct usbcam_txn *);

	int (*ctrl_txn_end)(struct usbcam_dev *udp, struct usbcam_txn *);

Each control is expected to provide storage for last committed control
values as well as current values.  The control structure gets a new
list_head, and operations:

	int (*set_fn)(struct usbcam_dev *, const struct usbcam_ctrl *,
		      const struct v4l2_ext_control *, struct usbcam_txn *);

	void (*commit_fn)(struct usbcam_dev *, const struct usbcam_ctrl *,
		      struct usbcam_txn *);

	void (*abort_fn)(struct usbcam_dev *, const struct usbcam_ctrl *,
		      struct usbcam_txn *);

The procedures would be:

Set extended controls:
- Invoke the minidriver ctrl_txn_start().  If it fails, return the error.
- Invoke each control's set_fn().  If successful, add the control to
the transaction list.  Otherwise, abort and return the error with the
index of the failing control.
- Commit the transaction, return success.

Commit:
- Invoke the commit_fn() of every control in the transaction list.
- Invoke the minidriver ctrl_txn_stop().

Abort:
- Invoke the abort_fn() of every control in the transaction list.
- Invoke the minidriver ctrl_txn_stop().

The only thing I don't like about this interface is that it might make
long waiting control requests a little bit more complicated in some
models.  For example, there might be some value in having an ioctl to
set a pan/tilt control wait until the device has reoriented itself.
Or, maybe it will simplify them by forcing the correct model the first
time.  Hm.

With your comment below in perspective, maybe the videodev layer
should do this stuff itself instead of usbcam.

&gt;<i> On a side note, you should split usbcam into several files. It will be easier
</I>&gt;<i> to read the code.
</I>
Agreed, done.  It makes for marginally more work to embed usbcam in a
3rd party driver though.

&gt;<i> Do you plan to submit usbcam to the kernel ? Do you think current USB drivers
</I>&gt;<i> could be ported ? One of the main issues is that developers might not be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to throw away most of the code they wrote.
</I>
The plan is actually to submit it, with r5u870, as a set of patches to
v4l-dvb in the next 2-3 days.  This isn't a lot of time, but there are
other things going on that mandate it.  I'll fix anything else you
deem worth fixing in the mean time.

If a patch is really big, what's the protocol, will they be offended
by an attachment?

The latest sources, including a small overhaul of the control API,
broken out into smaller files, and including the sq930 driver, are
temporarily at:

<A HREF="http://lsb.blogdns.net/files/sq930-dev.tgz">http://lsb.blogdns.net/files/sq930-dev.tgz</A>

I'll start playing around with a uvcvideo integration next, after we
figure out the control interfaces and the format/resolution handlers
get cleaned up.

&gt;<i> Are you aware that Mauro (the V4L2 maintainer) is trying to move ioctl
</I>&gt;<i> handling to the V4L2 layer, which is the first step to a mini driver
</I>&gt;<i> approach ? It seems to me that V4L2 is undergoing some major changes, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure to be happy with them. If we indeed decide that some operations
</I>&gt;<i> (such as buffer management) should be handled by generic code, this should be
</I>&gt;<i> discussed first on the video4linux mailing list.
</I>
I was hoping that they might spend a little more time refining this
stuff before embarking on their current activity of altering existing
drivers to use it.  This video_ioctl2() might make it marginally
simpler to specify a driver.

It is certainly less pleasant to support this model with usbcam.
usbcam has its own slightly more cooked table of callouts with
different semantics -- minidrivers want callouts invoked with the
device mutex held.  When a callout is added to video_device, it must
also be added to the usbcam callouts in order for usbcam minidrivers
to be able to use it, and that sounds like a lot of work and room for
version skew.

It seems cleaner to provide specific callouts only where value is
added, and to provide an uncooked ioctl callout for everything else.

I agree with your notion that they should make it a stronger sort of
minidriver interface, and have it manage frame buffers and keep track
of lists of controls, formats, resolutions, frame intervals, etc. per
device.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to simulate device unplugging/replugging from userspace to
</I>&gt;<i> force the USB stack to reenumerate the device ?
</I>
What, you want me to give away all my secrets?  :-)

Here's the snippet.  It is called after the libusb interface is
released, after the microcode upload finishes.  I wish there were some
way to do this with libusb.

void r5u870_bump_kernel(struct usb_device *dev)
{
	char filename[PATH_MAX];
	int fh;
	struct usbdevfs_ioctl ic;
	sprintf(filename, &quot;/proc/bus/usb/%s/%s&quot;,
		dev-&gt;bus-&gt;dirname, dev-&gt;filename);
	fh = open(filename, O_RDWR);
	if (fh &gt;= 0) {
		ic.ifno = 0;
		ic.ioctl_code = USBDEVFS_CONNECT;
		ioctl(fh, USBDEVFS_IOCTL, &amp;ic);
		close(fh);
	}
}

&gt;<i> I assume the firmware loading requests are not compatible with ezusb chips, so
</I>&gt;<i> fxload can't do the job. Is that right ?
</I>
That's right, it's a little bit different.

Were you considering trying to convince the fxload folks to integrate
the iSight/r5u870 firmware upload functionality?

If not, somebody should certainly create a uvcfwload project, or
something of the sort.  I'd do this myself but am not competent with
the accepted packaging standards for user level stuff.

&gt;<i> It could be included in the kernel instead, but it would then have to be a
</I>&gt;<i> generic microcode loader usable by several drivers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mind adding a few quirks to the uvcvideo driver. Support for non-UVC
</I>&gt;<i> controls is a bit more intrusive though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other ways to support those hybrid devices would be to add hooks to uvcvideo
</I>&gt;<i> or implement a minidriver interface like the one you wrote for usbcam.
</I>
I like the last idea.  What sort of interface did you have in mind?

It sounds like there are two types of help that devices might need in
order to be compatible with uvcvideo:

1. Loading microcode/firmware files
2. Non-standard controls, either UVC-defined private controls or
non-UVC controls

For cameras that need #1 and not #2, the user level firmware loader
seems to make the most sense.  This also seems like a common type of
device, and there will be more of them in the future than just the
iSight, and a user-level firmware uploader is probably a good idea.

For cameras that need #1 and #2, it might make the most sense to have
a uvcvideo plugin of some sort that handles the controls as well as
loading the firmware.  Separating the firmware loader and the control
functions might add confusion, because two separate components may
need to be upgraded / installed to support a device, but maybe that's
the most straightforward way to do it.

Thanks Laurent!
