Thanks for the diff. I'm still having issues with the reset patch, as it's a 
heavy workaround for a still not well understood problem. It also doesn't 
solve all issues with the Logitech hardware bug, some people still can't use 
their webcams despite the patch. I'd like to have a proper fix before 
committing this to the trunk.

&gt;<i> I used luvcview to test the camera. Then I tried xawtv, but as you

</I>&gt;<i> idea which library it uses as a backend) and it would do something, but not
</I>&gt;<i> a nice picture. This leads me to my final question: Which applications are

</I>
Marcel van Beurden reported a new motion beta release that might work with the 
Linux UVC driver. Ekiga is known to work, and xawtv should work with the 
attached patch which has been committed to 
<A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/linux-uvc/patches/xawtv.">svn://svn.berlios.de/linux-uvc/patches/xawtv.</A>

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
