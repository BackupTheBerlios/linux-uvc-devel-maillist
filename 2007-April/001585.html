<PRE>Hi Jim,

&gt;<i> I had a sneaky suspicion my camera was stuck in top quality. Laurent
</I>&gt;<i> Pinchart's comments from March 25th confirmed and were a nice
</I>&gt;<i> blueprint for this patch.
</I>
First of all, thanks for the patch.

&gt;<i> Possible rough edges:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -  I was unable to determine what the range of the
</I>&gt;<i> v4l2_jpegcompression.quality field should be, so I chose 0-100 since
</I>&gt;<i> that is familiar to users of JPEG, it is mapped to the allowed ranges
</I>&gt;<i> of the device, respecting the resolution.
</I>
The documentation is pretty unclear on this. I'm fine with a fixed 0-100 range 
for now.

&gt;<i> -  I didn't really understand the privilege issues, so I copied the
</I>&gt;<i> code from the VIDIOC_S_PARM, maybe the priv check should be removed.
</I>
The privilege code just makes sure that only a single user (application) can 
control streaming related parameters at a given time. Your patch is fine, 
except that it doesn't handle compression quality changes during streaming. 
As my code doesn't handle frame rates changes during streaming either, I 
can't blame you :-) I added this to my todo list.

&gt;<i> -  The code now defaults to the minimum quality instead of the
</I>&gt;<i> maximum. This is an unfortunate effect of getting a 0 passed in the
</I>&gt;<i> first time. There is a probably a good place to stick in a 10000 for
</I>&gt;<i> the first probe somewhere in the startup code.
</I>
I'll have a look at that.

&gt;<i> - At the bottom of uvc_probe_video() where it tries to fall back to a
</I>&gt;<i> lesser bandwidth mode (I think), I switched it to fall back to the
</I>&gt;<i> minimum quality instead of the maximum.
</I>
The parameters negotiation code wasn't complete anyway. This is also something 
I need to fix.

&gt;<i> - It only supports the quality field of the ioctl, but I think that
</I>&gt;<i> is appropriate.
</I>
Fine with me.

&gt;<i> - If the reported range and resolution would cause a divide by zero
</I>&gt;<i> error in the computation we just take the maximum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The &quot;get&quot; function returns the actual quality, not the requested. I
</I>&gt;<i> think that is appropriate, it expose the granularity to the application.
</I>
Yes, that's appropriate. The &quot;set&quot; function should change the quality field as 
well to report the actual value.

&gt;<i> Now I can drop my 640x480 frames from 100+kb/frame to 25kb or so.
</I>
Great :-) I'll have a look at the code after this weekend, and commit the 
changes to SVN.

Thanks a lot for your patch.

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
