Laurent,

Thanks for your reply.

Good question.  I'd guess that Ricoh webcams have non-UVC controls
because the manufacturer couldn't fit the required functionality into
the limited code space.  Some of these controls (but no UVC controls)
support auto-adjustment -- Exposure/AEC, Component WB/AWB, Gain/AGC.
There is no reason for these devices to support control change events,
but there would be if the auto controls were UVC.

Realistically, for full support, the driver needs a hard-coded list of
non-UVC controls for each device, and of course needs to be able to
issue private non-UVC set commands for these controls.  It's unclear
how to fit this into uvcvideo's clean, orderly control model, and
seems like a relatively large device-specific concession for an
otherwise generic driver.

&gt;<i> Agreed. I'd rather go for the first solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can we discuss the issues you mentioned, as well as all other issues you can
</I>&gt;<i> foresee ?
</I>
If uvcvideo had more complete frame buffer access methods, including
read and VIDIOCGMBUF, apps like camstream, motion, and wengophone
might work.

One way to do this would be to link uvcvideo against video-buf, and
implement a short VIDIOCGMBUF handler.

xawtv working would be another plus.

I also have a module used by r5u870 that takes care of common webcam
problems, called usbcam.  It handles device registration, file
operations, and V4L frame buffer access calls via video-buf.  It's
also the foundation for another driver under development for a more
exotic sq930b device.  I've been through many cycles tuning this
layer, listening to user complaints, tracing apps and figuring out how
to work around bugs, and refining its minidriver interface.  To try to
integrate it with uvcvideo would be interesting, and I'm willing to
adapt it to your liking.  This would be another way to fix the frame
buffer problems, and perhaps in a more reusable way.

&gt;<i> I'm still not sure if the firmware download operation should be handled by the
</I>&gt;<i> driver or by a userspace utility. The fxload software from the usbutils
</I>&gt;<i> package is meant to be called by the hotplug system. This would obviously be
</I>&gt;<i> easier for the driver :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do all Ricoh devices advertise a different class and/or USB pid before and

</I>
Indeed, so you started a big thread about this a few months ago.

Regarding the descriptor tables, the microcode and other volatile
state does not seem to have an effect on what is reported by Ricoh
webcam devices, so they don't behave like isight or ezusb devices.
This doesn't make it more difficult to do the microcode upload at user
level though -- the kernel driver must fail gracefully anyway when
probing a device without microcode, and a microcode uploader in this
case would have the additional problem of forcing the kernel driver to
re-probe the device, which isn't difficult.

I wrote up a prototype upload utility, including a solution for the
device re-probe problem, and tested it with my non-UVC camera.  This
utility should be enough to allow an unmodified uvcvideo to at least
grab frames from a Ricoh UVC camera.

There is little question that it is easier for the driver to outsource
microcode upload functions to a user level program.  Overall it sounds
much more complicated, because one must also create, maintain,
evangelize, and support a separate package.  If there is some other
reason that this sort of package must exist, fine, and if so, it might
be best to integrate the microcode upload functionality for as many
devices as possible into this package.

As for the other problems, the Ricoh cameras do appear to be evolving.
 Future models will probably follow the standard more completely and
do away with the non-UVC controls, and less device specific code might
be required of uvcvideo.  Where do you feel comfortable drawing the
line?

Thanks.
