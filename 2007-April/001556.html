<PRE>&gt;<i> Before including such hacks in the driver, I want to make sure they are 
</I>&gt;<i> actually helpful for more than a few users.
</I>
I can't help you with that: I have no idea how many people could benefit
from such a patch, and neither do I know how many people do benefit from
this patch.

&gt;<i> If the patch can solve timeout issues for more than 50% of the user base
</I>&gt;<i> (which does not mean preventing timeouts once every other time, but really
</I>&gt;<i> preventing all timeouts to happen  for most users), I would considering
</I>&gt;<i> including it.  A friend of mine has a laptop which suffers a lot from the
</I>&gt;<i> hardware bug.  Until now no patch has been able to help him.
</I>
Well, at least for me it turned a &quot;basically unusable&quot; Orbit MP webcam into
a &quot;fully functional&quot; webcam.  I'd expect you'd get more data/info about the
problem and its various manifestations if the patch were made more easily
available, e.g. with a -DUSB_RESET_HACK switch, and with explicit mentions
of it in READMEs and websites (accompanied with &quot;please tell us your
experience with it&quot;).

As long as the patch doesn't get in the way of the actual main
development/maintenance, given the widespread problem, I'd think it'd be
worth it to include such a hack.

&gt;<i> The other issue is that such a fix would better be made in the USB core,
</I>&gt;<i> not in the UVC driver.  Basically, I'd like a &quot;this works because...&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> patch better than a &quot;this seems to work but I don't know why&quot; patch.
</I>
I'm pretty sure that if we ever get to know *why* it &quot;works&quot;, we'll then be
in a position to write a real patch rather than a hack.
