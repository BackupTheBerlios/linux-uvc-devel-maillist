<PRE>Hi Sam,

&gt;<i> I'm currently working on a V4L driver for Ricoh webcams.  I write to
</I>&gt;<i> you because there is some apparent device support overlap that should
</I>&gt;<i> be resolved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To give a brief description of this type of hardware, all known
</I>&gt;<i> webcams of this sort are built in to laptops, including a handful of
</I>&gt;<i> models from Sony and HP, and they are built around an 8051
</I>&gt;<i> microcontroller.  Some of these devices report video class interface
</I>&gt;<i> descriptors.  Older devices report some sort of interface descriptor
</I>&gt;<i> claiming to be image class, but are nothing of the sort, and they even
</I>&gt;<i> managed to create at least two distinct non-UVC devices that report
</I>&gt;<i> the same 05ca:1870 device ID.
</I>
This explains why many users reported problems with their Ricoh webcams being 
unsupported.

&gt;<i> The Ricoh webcams that claim to support UVC indeed behave as true UVC
</I>&gt;<i> devices, and even work with uvcvideo, but with two caveats:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. A microcode image must be uploaded the first time the device is
</I>&gt;<i> used since the machine has been powered on.
</I>
We already had to deal with this issue for the iSight webcams integrated in 
the mactel notebooks.

&gt;<i> 2. Some picture controls are not described in the UVC interface
</I>&gt;<i> descriptors, and in fact these picture controls are set using the same
</I>&gt;<i> commands as non-UVC Ricoh webcams.
</I>
Is there any known reason for that ? That sounds a bit against the UVC spec.

&gt;<i> I have implemented complete support for three Ricoh UVC devices in my
</I>&gt;<i> driver, using a minimal UVC implementation.  These include:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 05ca:1810 - HP Pavilion Webcam
</I>&gt;<i> 05ca:1835 - Sony VGP-VCC5
</I>&gt;<i> 05ca:1836 - Sony VGP-VCC4
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting to the point, a system with both uvcvideo and r5u870 installed
</I>&gt;<i> will be a source of confusion.  Both uvcvideo and r5u870 will try to
</I>&gt;<i> attach to the above devices -- uvcvideo because of the video class
</I>&gt;<i> interface, r5u870 because of the device ID.  If the webcam does not
</I>&gt;<i> have microcode, uvcvideo will fail and r5u870 will succeed.  If the
</I>&gt;<i> webcam does have microcode, such as after unloading r5u870 and loading
</I>&gt;<i> uvcvideo, or after a warm boot, uvcvideo will succeed.  This is very
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent.
</I>
Indeed. Users will get confused.

&gt;<i> Either uvcvideo should fully support these three devices and future
</I>&gt;<i> Ricoh UVC devices, or it should blacklist them.
</I>
Agreed. I'd rather go for the first solution.

&gt;<i> Adding support to uvcvideo should not be terribly difficult and I'm willing
</I>&gt;<i> to propose a patch -- but if we go this route, I will grill other aspects of
</I>&gt;<i> uvcvideo to ensure that my users don't lose any application support.
</I>
Can we discuss the issues you mentioned, as well as all other issues you can 
foresee ?

&gt;<i> Aside, the Windows drivers for these devices are apparently
</I>&gt;<i> implemented as a pair of filter drivers around usbvideo.sys.  The
</I>&gt;<i> lower filter contains the microcode and handles the upload process,
</I>&gt;<i> and also handles the non-UVC picture control requests.
</I>
I'm still not sure if the firmware download operation should be handled by the 
driver or by a userspace utility. The fxload software from the usbutils 
package is meant to be called by the hotplug system. This would obviously be 
easier for the driver :-)

Do all Ricoh devices advertise a different class and/or USB pid before and 
after loading the firmware ?

We will also have to sort out legal problems associated with firmware 
redistribution.

Thank you for your work on UVC Ricoh devices. I hope to find a way to support 
those devices in the Linux UVC driver.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
