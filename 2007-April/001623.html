That's right.

</I>
Agreed. read() will be implemented as soon as I can find some spare time to do 
so. I went for the streaming I/O method first, as it's (at least in my 
opinion) the most important one. read() is definitely important as well.

&gt;<i> &gt; usbcam sounds interesting. Porting uvcvideo to usbcam would be lots of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work, and I'm not willing to do that for now. Feel free to give it a go
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though :-) Don't forget that the uvcvideo driver is quite complex, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it will eventually support video output as well, which falls out of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the scope of usbcam. You might have issues with control handling which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being rewritten to allow for runtime controls definitions through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specific ioctls. The extended control API will also have to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented by usbcam, and the mini drivers API will have to support
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control transactions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm definitely pleased you don't pin it in the same category as usbvideo. 
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The control handling is on the list of things to rework.  ALSA seems
</I>&gt;<i> to have a reasonable interface with the snd_kcontrol.  It might also
</I>&gt;<i> be nice if the V4L2 API were expanded to support change notifications
</I>&gt;<i> like ALSA.
</I>
Change notifications are needed for proper UVC support (especially for 
pan/tilt support). I mentioned the topic on the v4l mailing list, but nobody 
seemed really interested. Mauro told me the pan/tilt code was in his opinion 
out of the scope of v4l, and should be handled by a separate device. I of 
course strongly disagree on that.

&gt;<i> Regarding transactions, what did you have in mind?
</I>
UVC devices expose controls that can't easily be mapped to a single V4L 
control. A good example is pan/tilt support in Logitech webcams. To make 
diagonal motion possible, pan and tilt are exposed through a single UVC 
control. The driver exposes two V4L controls, one for pan and one for tilt. 
Using the legacy control API, it wouldn't be possible to move the camera 
diagonally.

With the extended control API, control changes can be grouped. Pan and tilt 
values can be passed to the driver in a single call. The driver walks the 
controls array, stores control values in private memory, and commit all 
controls at the end of the array. This requires 'begin' and 'commit' support. 
Rollback is used to reset the internal control data to sensible values if an 
error occurs while processing the array. If an error occurs during commit, I 
decided not to try to rollback controls already committed. This would be 
quite difficult, if not impossible at all.

&gt;<i> I do like how uvcvideo does this stuff.  It seems a lot like how
</I>&gt;<i> jbd/reiserfs handle filesystem transactions, although those aren't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily the best examples because they don't support undo.  It
</I>&gt;<i> also seems almost like overkill for uvcvideo, because it doesn't seem
</I>&gt;<i> to handle the case of a device rejecting a new control value, and
</I>&gt;<i> would be very hard to do this in a complete fashion anyway because of
</I>&gt;<i> the asynchronous notification method mandated by the spec.
</I>
Exactly. Transaction support is needed to group related controls together, but 
handling errors from the device would be too difficult. The driver checks 
control values against boundaries returned by the device, so those errors 
should be rare.

&gt;<i> Anyway, now it's time to reinvent the wheel yet again.  :-)  how about
</I>&gt;<i> this sort of interface for usbcam.  We create a new usbcam_txn
</I>&gt;<i> structure for the transaction handle, which has a list_head and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> some minidriver-specific state.  The minidriver gets new operations:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	int (*ctrl_txn_start)(struct usbcam_dev *udp, struct usbcam_txn *);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	int (*ctrl_txn_end)(struct usbcam_dev *udp, struct usbcam_txn *);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each control is expected to provide storage for last committed control
</I>&gt;<i> values as well as current values.  The control structure gets a new
</I>&gt;<i> list_head, and operations:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	int (*set_fn)(struct usbcam_dev *, const struct usbcam_ctrl *,
</I>&gt;<i> 		      const struct v4l2_ext_control *, struct usbcam_txn *);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	void (*commit_fn)(struct usbcam_dev *, const struct usbcam_ctrl *,
</I>&gt;<i> 		      struct usbcam_txn *);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	void (*abort_fn)(struct usbcam_dev *, const struct usbcam_ctrl *,
</I>&gt;<i> 		      struct usbcam_txn *);
</I>
This really sounds way too complex. As only a single transaction can be active 
at a given time, the set_fn doesn't need the struct usbcam_txn* argument. For 
the UVC driver, commit_fn and abort_fn operations would be useless, as what 
must be committed are UVC controls, not V4L controls.

For simple devices with a 1-to-1 mapping between device controls and V4L 
controls, transaction support is not useful. For more complex devices with a 
1-to-n mapping between device controls and V4L controls, the driver will 
store device control values and not V4L control values. This doesn't fit very 
well with the above API.

&gt;<i> The procedures would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Set extended controls:
</I>&gt;<i> - Invoke the minidriver ctrl_txn_start().  If it fails, return the error.
</I>&gt;<i> - Invoke each control's set_fn().  If successful, add the control to
</I>&gt;<i> the transaction list.  Otherwise, abort and return the error with the
</I>&gt;<i> index of the failing control.
</I>&gt;<i> - Commit the transaction, return success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Commit:
</I>&gt;<i> - Invoke the commit_fn() of every control in the transaction list.
</I>&gt;<i> - Invoke the minidriver ctrl_txn_stop().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Abort:
</I>&gt;<i> - Invoke the abort_fn() of every control in the transaction list.
</I>&gt;<i> - Invoke the minidriver ctrl_txn_stop().
</I>
Transaction support is *only* needed to let the driver group several V4L 
control values and send them to the device in a single operation. What the 
UVC driver needs is a control set notification (set_fn) to store the control 
value, a rollback notification to restore *all* modified values and a commit 
notification to push controls to the device.

Adding a

int (*ctrl_txn_end)(struct usbcam_dev *udp, int commit);

operation would be enough to handle this.

Actually, I even doubt control handling in usbcam should be used by the UVC 
driver. usbcam frees the driver from having to look up the controls list. As 
the UVC driver needs to lookup up its internal UVC control list anyway, there 
isn't much point in delegating controls handling to usbcam at all. Now, if 
you want to implement native device controls support with V4L controls 
mapping in usbcam, that's another story :-)

&gt;<i> The only thing I don't like about this interface is that it might make
</I>&gt;<i> long waiting control requests a little bit more complicated in some
</I>&gt;<i> models.  For example, there might be some value in having an ioctl to
</I>&gt;<i> set a pan/tilt control wait until the device has reoriented itself.
</I>
Shouldn't that be handled by a notification API ?

&gt;<i> Or, maybe it will simplify them by forcing the correct model the first
</I>&gt;<i> time.  Hm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With your comment below in perspective, maybe the videodev layer
</I>&gt;<i> should do this stuff itself instead of usbcam.
</I>
That would indeed be better. Lots of code in usbcam is not USB specific.

&gt;<i> &gt; On a side note, you should split usbcam into several files. It will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier to read the code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, done.  It makes for marginally more work to embed usbcam in a
</I>&gt;<i> 3rd party driver though.
</I>
usbcam shouldn't be embedded in a 3rd party driver. It should be a kernel 
module of its own.

&gt;<i> &gt; Do you plan to submit usbcam to the kernel ? Do you think current USB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drivers could be ported ? One of the main issues is that developers might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not be willing to throw away most of the code they wrote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The plan is actually to submit it, with r5u870, as a set of patches to
</I>&gt;<i> v4l-dvb in the next 2-3 days.  This isn't a lot of time, but there are
</I>&gt;<i> other things going on that mandate it.  I'll fix anything else you
</I>&gt;<i> deem worth fixing in the mean time.
</I>
This is too soon in my opinion. The API isn't stable yet. It can be used with 
the r5u870 driver, but it definitely shouldn't be used by other drivers yet. 
Otherwise you'll be stuck with API changes that you won't be allowed to make 
in the future, and it will just turn into a huge mess.

&gt;<i> If a patch is really big, what's the protocol, will they be offended
</I>&gt;<i> by an attachment?
</I>
I have no idea, sorry.

&gt;<i> The latest sources, including a small overhaul of the control API,
</I>&gt;<i> broken out into smaller files, and including the sq930 driver, are
</I>&gt;<i> temporarily at:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll start playing around with a uvcvideo integration next, after we
</I>&gt;<i> figure out the control interfaces and the format/resolution handlers
</I>&gt;<i> get cleaned up.
</I>
As stated above, I doubt the current control API could be useful at all for 
the UVC driver.

&gt;<i> &gt; Are you aware that Mauro (the V4L2 maintainer) is trying to move ioctl
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; handling to the V4L2 layer, which is the first step to a mini driver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approach ? It seems to me that V4L2 is undergoing some major changes, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure to be happy with them. If we indeed decide that some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operations (such as buffer management) should be handled by generic code,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this should be discussed first on the video4linux mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was hoping that they might spend a little more time refining this
</I>&gt;<i> stuff before embarking on their current activity of altering existing
</I>&gt;<i> drivers to use it.  This video_ioctl2() might make it marginally
</I>&gt;<i> simpler to specify a driver.
</I>
It also makes it impossible for drivers to implement private ioctls. For that 
reason alone, video_ioctl2() is dead on arrival for me.

&gt;<i> It is certainly less pleasant to support this model with usbcam.
</I>&gt;<i> usbcam has its own slightly more cooked table of callouts with
</I>&gt;<i> different semantics -- minidrivers want callouts invoked with the
</I>&gt;<i> device mutex held.  When a callout is added to video_device, it must
</I>&gt;<i> also be added to the usbcam callouts in order for usbcam minidrivers
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to use it, and that sounds like a lot of work and room for
</I>&gt;<i> version skew.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems cleaner to provide specific callouts only where value is
</I>&gt;<i> added, and to provide an uncooked ioctl callout for everything else.
</I>
Try to convince Mauro. I've been unsuccessful so far.

&gt;<i> I agree with your notion that they should make it a stronger sort of
</I>&gt;<i> minidriver interface, and have it manage frame buffers and keep track
</I>&gt;<i> of lists of controls, formats, resolutions, frame intervals, etc. per
</I>&gt;<i> device.
</I>
I'm not even sure to like the callout solution. Helper functions might be 
easier for driver developers.

After giving it some thoughts, USB webcams can probably be divided in two 
categories:

- Simple webcams are merely a USB bridge with an I2C interface to the sensor. 
Those webcams provide a fixed list of formats/resolutions/frame rates (or 
even a single format/resolution/frame rate) and a simple list of controls. 
For those webcams, usbcam seems appropriate, and should probably even be 
enhanced to provide support for sensor abstraction. A webcam driver would 
thus be made of a bridge driver, a sensor driver and some very limited 
specific code. usbcam would glue all the pieces together.

- Complex webcams such as UVC devices can be queried at runtime to find out 
the available formats, resolutions, frame rates and controls. Controls can be 
device-specific, user-space support is then needed to interface the controls 
properly. I don't think usbcam, with its mini driver approach, is appropriate 
here. What would be useful would be to abstract common functions and move 
them to a USB video layer (whatever it's called). For instance, buffer 
handling should probably not be done by the driver (I will see if videobuf 
can be used in uvcvideo, even though I don't really like the current API).

I don't think usbcam currently fulfills the needs of complex webcams.

&gt;<i> &gt; Is it possible to simulate device unplugging/replugging from userspace to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; force the USB stack to reenumerate the device ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What, you want me to give away all my secrets?  :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the snippet.  It is called after the libusb interface is
</I>&gt;<i> released, after the microcode upload finishes.  I wish there were some
</I>&gt;<i> way to do this with libusb.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> void r5u870_bump_kernel(struct usb_device *dev)
</I>&gt;<i> {
</I>&gt;<i> 	char filename[PATH_MAX];
</I>&gt;<i> 	int fh;
</I>&gt;<i> 	struct usbdevfs_ioctl ic;
</I>&gt;<i> 	sprintf(filename, &quot;/proc/bus/usb/%s/%s&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> 		dev-&gt;bus-&gt;dirname, dev-&gt;filename);
</I>&gt;<i> 	fh = open(filename, O_RDWR);
</I>&gt;<i> 	if (fh &gt;= 0) {
</I>&gt;<i> 		ic.ifno = 0;
</I>&gt;<i> 		ic.ioctl_code = USBDEVFS_CONNECT;
</I>&gt;<i> 		ioctl(fh, USBDEVFS_IOCTL, &amp;ic);
</I>&gt;<i> 		close(fh);
</I>&gt;<i> 	}
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I assume the firmware loading requests are not compatible with ezusb
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chips, so fxload can't do the job. Is that right ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's right, it's a little bit different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Were you considering trying to convince the fxload folks to integrate
</I>&gt;<i> the iSight/r5u870 firmware upload functionality?
</I>
The iSight uses an EZ-USB chip, so fxload can be used without any change.

&gt;<i> If not, somebody should certainly create a uvcfwload project, or
</I>&gt;<i> something of the sort.  I'd do this myself but am not competent with
</I>&gt;<i> the accepted packaging standards for user level stuff.
</I>
A ricohfwload would be better :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; It could be included in the kernel instead, but it would then have to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a generic microcode loader usable by several drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't mind adding a few quirks to the uvcvideo driver. Support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-UVC controls is a bit more intrusive though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Other ways to support those hybrid devices would be to add hooks to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uvcvideo or implement a minidriver interface like the one you wrote for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; usbcam.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the last idea.  What sort of interface did you have in mind?
</I>
I haven't thought about it yet, sorry.

&gt;<i> It sounds like there are two types of help that devices might need in
</I>&gt;<i> order to be compatible with uvcvideo:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Loading microcode/firmware files
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Non-standard controls, either UVC-defined private controls or
</I>&gt;<i> non-UVC controls
</I>
UVC-defined private controls are already handled by the UVC driver in the 
dynctrl branch. Non-UVC controls are another story, and I wish engineers did 
their job properly.

&gt;<i> For cameras that need #1 and not #2, the user level firmware loader
</I>&gt;<i> seems to make the most sense.  This also seems like a common type of
</I>&gt;<i> device, and there will be more of them in the future than just the
</I>&gt;<i> iSight, and a user-level firmware uploader is probably a good idea.
</I>
We will either need to expand fxload to handle other USB microcontrollers, or 
write a loader for every microcontroller. Expanding fxload might be better, 
as it already handles hex file parsing.

&gt;<i> For cameras that need #1 and #2, it might make the most sense to have
</I>&gt;<i> a uvcvideo plugin of some sort that handles the controls as well as
</I>&gt;<i> loading the firmware.  Separating the firmware loader and the control
</I>&gt;<i> functions might add confusion, because two separate components may
</I>&gt;<i> need to be upgraded / installed to support a device, but maybe that's
</I>&gt;<i> the most straightforward way to do it.
</I>
I'm not completely against a kernel space firmware loader, providing it lives 
in a separate module and can be used by other drivers as well. It doesn't 
make sense to bundle an EZ-USB firmware loader with the UVC driver.

Speaking of firmwares, does Ricoh allows firmware redistribution ? If so, 
which license are the firmwares covered by ?

&gt;<i> Thanks Laurent!
</I>
You're welcome. Hope you won't find my comments too negative. Otherwise feel 
free to tell me.

Laurent Pinchart
