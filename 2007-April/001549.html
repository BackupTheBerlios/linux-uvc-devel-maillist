<PRE>Hi Stefan,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2007-March/001476.htm">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2007-March/001476.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;l
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; .. the reset functionality is a part of a patch that is applied against
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the UVC Module that get compiled and included in the kernel.  From
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; my reading of the code, it automatically resets the USB device (without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; user intervention).  Thus no command is required.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But, to my understanding, this patch is not included by default in UVC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's right.  The patch helped a few people, but failed to fix the bug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for others.  As this is a pretty intrusive workaround, I'm not really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keen on including it by default if it can't fix the problem for most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm... I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;intrusive&quot; here (I don't understand
</I>&gt;<i> the UVC code, really, but when I applied the patch by hand, it seemed
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably conceptually clean and unintrusive in that it just hooks into
</I>&gt;<i> a few places that are not performance sensitive;  Its behavior is obviously
</I>&gt;<i> an ugly hack).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't want to have the patch included as-is, and especially the hack
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be enabled by default, but I'm wondering: what changes would you
</I>&gt;<i> want to see before such a patch could be considered as acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd obviously start with adding a module argument named something like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;use_reset_hack&quot;, but what else?
</I>&gt;<i> Would you want the whole hack to be carefully wrapped in #ifdefs?
</I>
Before including such hacks in the driver, I want to make sure they are 
actually helpful for more than a few users. If the patch can solve timeout 
issues for more than 50% of the user base (which does not mean preventing 
timeouts once every other time, but really preventing all timeouts to happen 
for most users), I would considering including it. A friend of mine has a 
laptop which suffers a lot from the hardware bug. Until now no patch has been 
able to help him.

The other issue is that such a fix would better be made in the USB core, not 
in the UVC driver. Basically, I'd like a &quot;this works because...&quot; patch better 
than a &quot;this seems to work but I don't know why&quot; patch.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
