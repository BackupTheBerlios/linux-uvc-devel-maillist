Bayer mode is an image encoding standard that's not currently supported by  
the UVC specification, which is one of the reasons why it probably won't  
make its way into the UVC driver.

Another one is that V4L2 drivers are not supposed to decode the image  
data. There was a lot of discussion on that topic in the past and the  
bottom line is that even though there's no unified V4L2 library that could  
take care of this, drivers are not supposed to do it. This leaves it up to  
the app to do any sort of decoding.

That being said, the UVC driver doesn't really care about the video data  
that it relays to the app. In the case of some Logitech cameras you can  
switch them to Bayer mode and then do the decoding in user space. I posted  
a quick how-to on this topic a while ago, you should be able to find it in  
the archives.

&gt;<i> .. and makes mention of this special case;
</I>&gt;<i>  	/* special case: VGA @ 5 fps and snapshot is raw bayer mode */
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I take it this is the single image capture mode that
</I>&gt;<i> UVC doesn't support yet?
</I>
Still image capture is indeed not supported yet. It shouldn't be too  
difficult to implement but the main question to resolve is: How do you get  
the still image to the app? V4L2 has no support for this today, so you'd  
have to come up with another interface. My favorite is &quot;dd if=/dev/video0  
of=mypic.jpg&quot; but nobody's had time to implement that so far. :-)

Cheers,
Martin
