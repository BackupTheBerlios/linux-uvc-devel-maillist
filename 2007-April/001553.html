<PRE>Hi Paul,

&gt;<i> &gt; The SCR value increases with each incoming isochronous packet, so it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not constant across a video frame.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are right, but this is the only field having device SOF counter value.
</I>&gt;<i> It is needed to establish correspondence between device internal clock
</I>&gt;<i> (STC) and device SOF counter.
</I>
Actually, the idea isn't to establish a correspondence between the device 
internal clock and the SOF counter, but to allow the host to compensate for 
the device internal clock drift (mostly for audio/video synchronisation in a 
single USB device).

&gt;<i> It is not needed every video frame, in fact, 
</I>&gt;<i> single value should be sufficient assuming we know details about STC and
</I>&gt;<i> SOF counter period/overflow/reload. Value of PTS is probably not a good
</I>&gt;<i> alternative for synchronizing two devices, because it would be really
</I>&gt;<i> surprising to see their internal clocks synchronized. All above concerns
</I>&gt;<i> only experimental driver, it doesn't have to be a part of final driver.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I went through section 5.12 twice and I don't see anything helpful there,
</I>&gt;<i> in fact it is discouraging. UVC stipulates that compliant devices use
</I>&gt;<i> Isochronous Asynchronous mode, which means that device internal clock (STC)
</I>&gt;<i> is free running and doesn't synchronize with USB bus. It is perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable, since most users don't care about camera pixel clock being
</I>&gt;<i> synchronized with USB clock. They care about frame rate being stable and
</I>&gt;<i> possibly synchronized with audio. It seems that what I described in
</I>&gt;<i> previous paragraph is the only way to synchronize the device and USB
</I>&gt;<i> clocks.
</I>
Synchronising multiple devices can only be achieved if their internal SOF 
counter is synchronised with the host. This is possible with at least current 
Logitech webcams.

Both the PTS and SCR fields are needed to synchronise devices. The image 
timestamp expressed in internal device clock units is available through PTS. 
We need to convert that timestamp to host clock units. This is were SCR gets 
helpful, as it reports a relation between the internal device clock and the 
USB SOF counter. If you can find a way to get the relation between the USB 
SOF counter and the host clock, you could convert the PTS field to a host 
timestamp using some kind of (basic or advanced, I don't know) statistical 
processing.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
