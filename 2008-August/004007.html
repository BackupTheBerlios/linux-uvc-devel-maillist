<PRE>Hi Alex,

</I>
I've discussed firmware loading issues previously with iSight developers, and 
I wasn't very keen on adding firmware loading support to the UVC driver, 
especially with a userspace utility already available (the iSight is based on 
a Cypress chip). How do Ricoh webcams enumerate when the firmware is not 
loaded ? Is the firmware loading protocol specific to Ricoh devices ?

&gt;<i> One thing that might be an issue that I'm not sure was ever resolved in the
</I>&gt;<i> communication between yourself and Chris was that regarding the UVC
</I>&gt;<i> controls. As you might remember, the microcode that gets uploaded to the
</I>&gt;<i> camera doesn't report all the controls it supports. Would it be possible to
</I>&gt;<i> use some of the quirk modes provided by uvcvideo to get around that?
</I>
Could you list the Ricoh &quot;features&quot; that are not UVC-compliant ? Are the 
non-reported controls addressed with standard UVC requests or with a 
proprietary protocol ?

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
