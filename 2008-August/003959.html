I didn't know it was working in luvcview. That's an important piece of 
information.

&gt;<i> It also seems to work with 'motion', but no luck with other programs,
</I>&gt;<i> like camorama, cheese, camstream or skype.
</I>
camorama and camstream don't support v4l2 so they won't work with the uvcvideo 
driver.

cheese uses gstreamer, which in theory should work. Make sure you use a recent 
version, as various bugs which made gstreamer not compatible with uvcvideo 
should have been fixed.

As for skype, I really can't help. The software is proprietary and many people 
have encountered various issues when trying to use it, so I don't know which 
of skype or the driver/camera is to blame.

&gt;<i> skype doesn't even print any error msg, it crashes and that's it.
</I>&gt;<i> It keeps crashing until I unload uvcvideo, very annoying.
</I>
Does uvcvideo print any error message in the kernel log when skype crashes ? 
Either the driver crashes, in which case you will get a lengthy oops report 
in the kernel log, and the skype crash is then understandable, or skype has a 
bug that makes it crash.

&gt;<i> &gt; You could also try not to load the usbaudio driver at all. Timing-related
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues that lead to a camera crash can be caused by many things, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; audio-related requests could crash a perfectly working video device.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No good news from this front.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe the Hercules Dualpix uses a faulty USB chip (I would be interested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in knowing the chip brand and model if you can manage to open the case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without breaking anything).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have such a tiny screwdriver now, but in the case I'll let you
</I>&gt;<i> know.
</I>
Ok.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
