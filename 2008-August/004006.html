Hi Laurent,

Way back in April last year, Sam Revitch sent an email to
linux-uvc-devel[1] announcing the work he had been doing on r5u870, which
provided a working webcam to those users with cameras using the Ricoh
chipset. In January this year, I took up the task of maintaining the driver
(since Sam had seemingly gone MIA). Maintaining an out-of-kernel driver and
having very little time to tend to it (we now support 15 different camera
models, up from 3 ;) has become very difficult as of late, and bug reports
regarding conflicts between the r5u870 and uvcvideo modules seem to
becoming more and more frequent. uvcvideo also seems to do a better job at
the UVC stuff than the other driver on most devices, anyway.

I've done a bit of hacking in an effort to retrofit uvcvideo with the
firmware-loading functionality of the original r5u870 driver. It appears to
work reasonably well. However, before I go and work on something worth
committing, I was just curious as to whether I should be attempting to
implement it in the kernel module (less work for me :) or as a userspace
application.

One thing that might be an issue that I'm not sure was ever resolved in the
communication between yourself and Chris was that regarding the UVC
controls. As you might remember, the microcode that gets uploaded to the
camera doesn't report all the controls it supports. Would it be possible to
use some of the quirk modes provided by uvcvideo to get around that?

Cheers,
Alex Hixon
