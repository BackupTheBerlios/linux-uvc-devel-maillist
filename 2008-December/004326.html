<PRE>Hi Juho,

</I>
No worries.

&gt;<i> On 26.11.2008, at 5.21, Laurent Pinchart wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is not completely true. Controls are added to the entity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controls list in ascending index order, so manual controls will always
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; come before auto controls (at least for the processing unit).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, in that case it is true because of how they are sorted. I didn't
</I>&gt;<i> dare to count on it though...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However it works again for me and that's what matters now. I hope
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to get this thing resolved some day in the official version too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; though. :) 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let's work on this then :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The patch indeed looked a bit messy at first. I've been trying to rework
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it for the past hour but ran into various issues and I now understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementing a clean solution is not as easy as it might seem. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are several places where control blacklisting can be implemented. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we want to use information taken from uvc_control_info (such as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; control selector) the location you picked is the right one. However, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; driver then needs to walk the entities and controls lists over again and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; free data allocated during the initialisation process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another solution would be to blacklist controls before they are allocated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We would then process the bmControls bitmask instead of the controls list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This approach is more efficient, but probably less generic as it won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow the driver to blacklist controls based on advanced information taken
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from uvc_control_info.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As both solutions have advantages and drawbacks let's remember Linus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Torvald and his famous quote about overdesign. Here's a simplified version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the patch that optionally (based on a device quirk) removes processing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unit auto controls when no corresponding manual control is available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you please test the patch and report the results ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that this version is cleaner than mine, at least it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> free memory blocks and hold the mutex while doing it. :)
</I>
It's also much simpler, so I might have to redo it if more complex needs arise 
later.

&gt;<i> Also adding the device quirk was something that I was thinking should be
</I>&gt;<i> added but wanted to ask for comments first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latest patch had a small thinko though, you wrote &quot;entity-&gt;extension&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> the controls and size getting when it should be &quot;entity-&gt;processing&quot; in this
</I>&gt;<i> case. I'll attach a new tested version of the patch where that is fixed, it
</I>&gt;<i> should have no other changes.
</I>
Oops. Thanks for spotting this.

&gt;<i> Thanks again and tell let me know if there's something else I could/should
</I>&gt;<i> do. :) 
</I>
You're welcome. I've committed the change to my repository on linuxtv.org and 
will push it upstream soon.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
