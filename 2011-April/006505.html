<PRE>This might not be entirely related to the UVC driver, but there seems to 
be a great pool of knowledge about webcams here, so I appreciate any 
feedback on this.

I am using some Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 cameras for a cctv project. 
Footage recorded by the camera of people/objects on the move is 
generally blurry. If the movement is slow, the footage is sharper - but 
as soon as they move a little faster (people walking about) - the 
footage is really quite blurry until they stop - and then it is sharp 
again. It is worse in low light, but it is still quite bad even in day 
light.

My questions are:

1. Would this be fairly specific to the Logitech QuickCam 9000, or is a 
more generic issue with webcam sensors?
2. Are other webcams better in this respect?
3. Can I use any of the UVC features to tweak the driver parameters in 
order to force sharper images of objects on the move?
4. Is this to do with the auto-focus of the camera, and can I turn it 
off or peg it in software at a certain value, to improve things?

Any hints on this are greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Sebastian
