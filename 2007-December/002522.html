<PRE> &gt; &gt; Now, I  have compiled and installed uvcvideo, V4L and just about
anything
 &gt; &gt; vaguely related from apt-get on my Debian lenny 2.6.22-3-k7
 &gt; &gt; But Ekiga still says  my video driver doesn't support the requested
format.

 &gt; Try upgrading to a more recent Ekiga version, and make sure you have
installed
 &gt; the libpt-plugins-v4l2  package.

Thanks; Laurent, but it's still not working... which version of ekiga would
you recommend ?
I have 2.03 which is the latest available for lenny from apt-get;

I see a version for ubuntu-lenny that has v. 2.0.11 yet uses older libpt
libs than I
 have on my non-ubuntu lenny  and it looks very tricky to install an ubuntu
deb on vanilla debian..
anyway...

I have installed the libplugins for V4L2 but nothing has changed except that
now
even Skype no longer shows anything in the test window -- even tho the
little blue light
does come on, although that already started before I installed any new
libs..
Ekiga continues to say my video driver doesn't support the requested format.

Furthermore, skype never really worked after all since in a real video call;
it would display video
for only a few seconds and then freeze. And it the self-viewing inset would
just go blank..
I'm beginning to wonder if the webcam is defective..

Can you or anybody suggest more diagnostics before I send the thing back ?

thanks again
- John
