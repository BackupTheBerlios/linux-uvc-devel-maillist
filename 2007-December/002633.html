</I>
The problem is not Ubuntu-specific. I *think* it is unfortunately 
device-specific. The device failed to answer two requests. The first one 
(135) is a very common device bug that the driver works around. The second 
one seems to be another device bug that the driver can't work around :-/

Basically, the driver queries the device, and the device stalls (refuses to 
answer the request). As this doesn't happen everytime, I suspect the problem 
to be caused by a firmware bug in the device.

It might be possible to implement a software workaround in the UVC driver by 
adding a small delay in one place or another, but I don't know of any 
definitive solution. The device passed manufacturer's testing because Windows 
and Linux schedule USB transactions differently, which results in slower 
timings in Windows. The bug just slipped uncaught.

It might also be possible to tweak the EHCI controller driver to alter timings 
and make them more Windows-like. That would be a complex project, involving 
deep knowledge of the EHCI host controller. The documentation is out there 
though.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
