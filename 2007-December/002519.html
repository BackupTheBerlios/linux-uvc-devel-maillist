<PRE>Hi John,

Try upgrading to a more recent Ekiga version, and make sure you have installed 
the libpt-plugins-v4l2  package.

&gt;<i> And camorama says my /dev/video0/ is not there when it most certainly is
</I>&gt;<i> -- and it sure looks like a device; too.? 
</I>
Camorama doesn't support V4L2 so it won't work with the UVC driver.

&gt;<i> Should my webcam work outside of skype ?
</I>
Your webcam should work with any video software that supports V4L2.

&gt;<i> When I plug it in, I get &quot;cannot get freq at ep 0x84 which seems to be a
</I>&gt;<i> common problem with webcams but which means nothing to me..
</I>
That error is related to the usbaudio module and should not affect the video 
driver.

&gt;<i> Elsewhere it was suggested that reloading the module with trace=15 might
</I>&gt;<i> help.. it didn't for me..
</I>
Setting trace to 15 prints more debugging messages to the kernel log but 
shouldn't affect the driver's behaviour (except maybe for some border-line 
timing related problems).

&gt;<i> Although I am a linux user since RedHat 3, I am still no guru, especially
</I>&gt;<i> with drivers and modules, and even less with video; so let's not ignore the
</I>&gt;<i> basics.. I may be missing something fundamental..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can send usb logs and lsusb output and all if useful, but I thought I
</I>&gt;<i> would just ask first, can I get my cam to work in other linux apps or only
</I>&gt;<i> skype for now ?
</I>
Camorama won't work, but Ekiga should. It will probably work if you upgrade to 
a more recent version. You might have to upgrade libpt too.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
