I'm using 2.0.11. I don't know if it will fix your problem, but it might be 
worth a shot.

&gt;<i> I see a version for ubuntu-lenny that has v. 2.0.11 yet uses older libpt

</I>&gt;<i> Ekiga continues to say my video driver doesn't support the requested

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, skype never really worked after all since in a real video

</I>
Video support in Skype is still beta so I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't 
work properly.

&gt;<i> I'm beginning to wonder if the webcam is defective..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you or anybody suggest more diagnostics before I send the thing back ?
</I>
You could try luvcview or ucview, they are both known to work properly with 
the Linux UVC driver.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
