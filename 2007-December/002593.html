<PRE>Hi Lambros,

</I>&gt;<i> unstable, with random segfaults (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ekiga/+bug/164942">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ekiga/+bug/164942</A> ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried the latest uvcvideo driver from the SVN trunk (revision
</I>&gt;<i> 151) but the behaviour is no different.  I have also tried various
</I>&gt;<i> patches that I found, with no luck (either the patches failed to apply,
</I>&gt;<i> or there was no difference in behaviour).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever the problem occurs, I always get this in my 'dmesg' output:
</I>&gt;<i> [ 6045.133998] uvcvideo: Failed to resubmit video URB (-45).
</I>&gt;<i> [ 6045.134047] uvcvideo: Failed to resubmit video URB (-45).

</I>&gt;<i> [ 6045.134131] uvcvideo: Failed to resubmit video URB (-45).
</I>
I don't like that :-(

&gt;<i> I get the same diagnostics if I use 'trace=15' when loading the module -
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't seem to give any more information (I use the command 'sudo
</I>&gt;<i> modprobe uvcvideo trace=15').  Would I need to configure
</I>&gt;<i> 'CONFIG_USB_DEBUG=y' to get more helpful debug information?  Would I
</I>&gt;<i> need to recompile the Ubuntu kernel to do this?
</I>
I don't think CONFIG_USB_DEBUG would help, except maybe by slowing the kernel 
down a bit. You will have to recompile the Ubuntu kernel, or at least the USB 
modules if the USB subsystem is built as a module.

&gt;<i> I notice that the problem is not permanent.  In Skype, I can simply stop
</I>&gt;<i> and start my video to get the camera running for another minute or so.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there some way I could modify the driver to automatically reset the
</I>&gt;<i> device when this error-condition occurs?  Obviously this wouldn't be a
</I>&gt;<i> proper solution, but it would meet my needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried modifying the driver, to resubmit the video URB when the
</I>&gt;<i> particular error-code &quot;-45&quot; is returned.  This does not help - it simply
</I>&gt;<i> fails again with the same error code.
</I>
Was worth a shot as a workaround.

&gt;<i> From looking around the 'net, it appears that -45 refers to -EL2NSYNC,
</I>&gt;<i> which is reportedly only used by ehci_hcd, and is perhaps audio-related.
</I>&gt;<i> I disabled my audio driver &quot;snd_hda_intel&quot;, but this did not help.
</I>
EL2NSYNC is returned by the EHCI HCD driver when it has trouble scheduling an 
isochronous URB. I'm not sure if this is caused by a wrong behaviour of the 
uvcvideo driver or by a bug in the ehci_hcd driver itself.

&gt;<i> Would it be helpful for me to try the 32-bit version of Ubuntu instead
</I>&gt;<i> of the 64-bit version?  I don't want to try this if it would be wasted
</I>&gt;<i> effort.
</I>
I doubt it would help, but that's always worth a shot if everything else 
fails.

&gt;<i> I did some searching on the &quot;OmniVision&quot; webcam but I could find very
</I>&gt;<i> little information.  By all accounts, this camera is supposed to work
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly with Free Software (but sadly, not for me).  It is built into
</I>&gt;<i> the screen of my laptop, so I really would like to get it working,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of just buying another cheap webcam to plug into the side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help debugging this would be much appreciated.  Please let me know
</I>&gt;<i> what further info would be useful.
</I>
I would start by trying a vanilla kernel instead of the Ubuntu kernel. Ubuntu 
might ship patches that affect the ehci scheduler.

If it still fails, we should raise the problem on the linux-usb mailing list 
to find out who is to blame. I don't have enough knowledge of the ehci driver 
to understand its scheduling policy.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
