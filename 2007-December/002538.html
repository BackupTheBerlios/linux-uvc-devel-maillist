<PRE>Hi Jean,

On Monday 03 December 2007, Jean Tourrilhes wrote:
&gt;<i> 	Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	After some research, I bought a Logitech Quickcam Communicate
</I>&gt;<i> Deluxe (046d:0992). I can report that it work perfectly with luvcview,
</I>&gt;<i> but does not work properly with Skype.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Note that Ligitech names are somewhat confusing. Do not

</I>&gt;<i> or the Quickcam Deluxe for Notebooks (UVC + fixed focus).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       I believe that this precise model is the safest buy amongst
</I>&gt;<i> Logitech UVC webcams, other Logitech UVC cameras have either &quot;the bug&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or are autofocus models (or fixed focus).
</I>&gt;<i> 	This model, the Logitech Quickcam Communicate Deluxe
</I>&gt;<i> (046d:0992) is listed by Logitech as having the new chip inside
</I>&gt;<i> (SPCA527) and does not seem to have &quot;the bug&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 		<A HREF="http://www.quickcamteam.net/hcl/linux/logitech-webcams">http://www.quickcamteam.net/hcl/linux/logitech-webcams</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 	This model has manual focus, all other SPCA527 models have
</I>&gt;<i> autofocus, and autofocus is currently not supported well under
</I>&gt;<i> Linux. I'm not going to pay more to have what effectively becomes a
</I>&gt;<i> fixed focus camera.
</I>
None of the existing SPCA527 models have hardware autofocus. All the models 
referenced as having autofocus on Logitech's website have a USB-controllable 
manual focus that is supported by the Linux UVC driver. Autofocus is 
implemented in software in the Windows driver.

&gt;<i> 	This model is currently still a bit expensive, probably
</I>&gt;<i> because it was released not long ago, hopefully with time the price
</I>&gt;<i> should go down.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Note that I said the &quot;safest Logitech UVC webcams&quot;. There are
</I>&gt;<i> other very good non-UVC Logitech webcams, I am personally very happy
</I>&gt;<i> with the PRO 3000 and PRO 4000 (both pwc), however their new lines has
</I>&gt;<i> very few webcams with manual focus. And I bet there are also very good
</I>&gt;<i> UVC non-Logitech webcams.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	With luvcview : work up to 960x720, which is the highest
</I>&gt;<i> resolution in mjpeg mode. The image is very crisp and clear. It
</I>&gt;<i> basically work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	With xawtv (version 4, from CVS). For some reasons, I could
</I>&gt;<i> not make the option '-device /dev/video1' work. When I unplugged my
</I>&gt;<i> primary webcam, then xawtv worked fine at 1280x960 using YUYV, which
</I>&gt;<i> is the highest resolution of the webcam. Image quality is real good to
</I>&gt;<i> my eyes.
</I>&gt;<i> 	Note that xawtv 3.95 does not sem to support v4l2.
</I>
xawtv 3.95 has a small bug that prevents it from working with the Linux UVC 
driver. It works with some other V4L2 drivers.

&gt;<i> 	With skype 2.0 beta : audio work. Image is black or
</I>&gt;<i> corrupted. It does not work well.
</I>&gt;<i> 	It seems that the Skype guys are working on it. I have not
</I>&gt;<i> tried yet any workaround found on the Skype forums.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	I'll still have the webcam for a few days before &quot;gifting&quot; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	Have fun...
</I>
Thanks for sharing your opinion. I'm sure other users will find this helpful.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
