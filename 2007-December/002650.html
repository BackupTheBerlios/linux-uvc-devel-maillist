I tried to add this ID to the ucv_driver.c file and compiled afterwards:

--------------------
static struct usb_device_id uvc_ids[] = {
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;/* Dell XPS M2010 built-in webcam */
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; { .match_flags &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;= USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_DEVICE
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; | USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_INT_INFO,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .idVendor &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; = 0x046d,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .idProduct &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;= 0x0897,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .bInterfaceClass &#160; &#160; &#160;= USB_CLASS_VENDOR_SPEC,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .bInterfaceSubClass &#160; = 1,
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; .bInterfaceProtocol &#160; = 0 },
--------------------

The module loads smoothly &quot;modprobe -v uvcvideo&quot; sais:

install /sbin/modprobe snd_usb_audio; /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install uvcvideo
insmod /lib/modules/2.6.22.13-0.3-default/usb/media/uvcvideo.ko

and adds the following output to /var/log/messages:

Dec 27 15:57:55 onyx kernel: usbcore: deregistering interface driver uvcvideo
Dec 27 15:57:59 onyx kernel: usbcore: registered new interface driver uvcvideo
Dec 27 15:57:59 onyx kernel: USB Video Class driver (v0.1.0)

But still, I do not have a /dev/video0 device.

&quot;lsmod | grep uvc&quot; tells me that the modules seem to be working:

uvcvideo &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 52356 &#160;0 
compat_ioctl32 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;5376 &#160;1 uvcvideo

uvcvideo,uhci_hcd,gspca,snd_usb_audio,snd_usb_lib,usbhid,ehci_hcd

Any idea would I should do to get my webcam working? As far as this is an 
Logitech device, this should not be a big problem, should it?

Greets,
Andreas
