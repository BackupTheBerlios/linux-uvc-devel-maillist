<PRE>	Hi,

	After some research, I bought a Logitech Quickcam Communicate
Deluxe (046d:0992). I can report that it work perfectly with luvcview,
but does not work properly with Skype.
	Note that Ligitech names are somewhat confusing. Do not
confuse it either with the Quickcam Communicate STX (a spca5xx model)
or the Quickcam Deluxe for Notebooks (UVC + fixed focus).

      I believe that this precise model is the safest buy amongst
Logitech UVC webcams, other Logitech UVC cameras have either &quot;the bug&quot;
or are autofocus models (or fixed focus).
	This model, the Logitech Quickcam Communicate Deluxe
(046d:0992) is listed by Logitech as having the new chip inside
(SPCA527) and does not seem to have &quot;the bug&quot;.
		<A HREF="http://www.quickcamteam.net/hcl/linux/logitech-webcams">http://www.quickcamteam.net/hcl/linux/logitech-webcams</A>
	This model has manual focus, all other SPCA527 models have
autofocus, and autofocus is currently not supported well under
Linux. I'm not going to pay more to have what effectively becomes a
fixed focus camera.
	This model is currently still a bit expensive, probably
because it was released not long ago, hopefully with time the price
should go down.
	Note that I said the &quot;safest Logitech UVC webcams&quot;. There are
other very good non-UVC Logitech webcams, I am personally very happy
with the PRO 3000 and PRO 4000 (both pwc), however their new lines has
very few webcams with manual focus. And I bet there are also very good
UVC non-Logitech webcams.

	With luvcview : work up to 960x720, which is the highest
resolution in mjpeg mode. The image is very crisp and clear. It
basically work.

	With xawtv (version 4, from CVS). For some reasons, I could
not make the option '-device /dev/video1' work. When I unplugged my
primary webcam, then xawtv worked fine at 1280x960 using YUYV, which
is the highest resolution of the webcam. Image quality is real good to
my eyes.
	Note that xawtv 3.95 does not sem to support v4l2.

	With skype 2.0 beta : audio work. Image is black or
corrupted. It does not work well.
	It seems that the Skype guys are working on it. I have not
tried yet any workaround found on the Skype forums.

	I'll still have the webcam for a few days before &quot;gifting&quot; it.

	Have fun...

	Jean
