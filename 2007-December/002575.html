I can't agree more with you. I don't treat Skype-related issues differently 
than other issues. If the driver is at fault because it doesn't implement a 
feature according to the V4L2 spec, I will try to fix it. On the other hand, 
if the application behaves incorrectly, I won't be able to look at its source 
code so I tell users to report the problem to Skype technical support.

As far as I'm concerned, Skype is a second-class citizen that I don't care 
much about. If it works, fine, but if it doesn't I'm definitely not going to 
add workarounds to the driver.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
