<PRE>	Hi all,

	I was planning to reply to you all and do more test, but
unfortunately did not find the time. Sorry about that. Maybe during
the Chrismas break I'll find a few minutes.
	Thanks for your response and encouragment.

	Yes, the Skype situation is evolving as we speak. It seems
that they have released a new beta and that setting the frame size and
frame rate do help. I was planning to test that.
	Because of the fluidity of the situation, I decided to not
elaborate in my original e-mail.

	I've never said those have hardware autofocus (wow, I wish it
was the case), I was just quoting the commonly accepted categorisation
of webcams, which are &quot;fixed&quot;, &quot;manual&quot; and &quot;autofocus&quot;.
	If you want to get detailed, they do have hardware support for
autofocus and limited support for manual focus. Manual focus
photographic cameras and webcams usually have a ring or wheel to
adjust the focus. On the Quickcam Communicate Deluxe, there is a wheel
on the right of the webcam to adjust focus, on the pro3000/pro4000 you
turn the black ring around the lens. On the other hand, the Quickcam
Communicate Deluxe will never support autofocus, as it doesn't have
hardware support for autofocus.
	Note that the implementation of autofocus in most point and
shoot digital cameras is software controlled (contrast detection on
the main sensor run by the main CPU). When you look at the system
view, the Logitech webcam solution is similar, focus is achieved
automatically and continuously by the software on the main CPU (in the
driver) using contrast detection (in the driver).

	Now, implementation of autofocus in Linux will require some
change. You can't force every single application to implement the
autofocus itself. And you don't want to push it in the driver. It
seems obvious that some framework change is needed.
	For example, you could modify V4L2 to allow two application to
simultaneously get data from the driver, one would be your main webcam
app, and the second a specific autofocus app. The same way two apps
can simultaneously read data from a NIC or a disk. There is many other
ways to do it, all seems to require framework change (either kernel or
userspace).
	I personally don't see that happening overnight, therefore I
decided against an &quot;autofocus&quot; webcam.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	Note that xawtv 3.95 does not sem to support v4l2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> xawtv 3.95 has a small bug that prevents it from working with the Linux UVC 
</I>&gt;<i> driver. It works with some other V4L2 drivers.
</I>
	Ok, I stand corrected. Anyway, I did not care about xawtv, I
just wanted to test YUYV and the highest resolution.

&gt;<i> Thanks for sharing your opinion. I'm sure other users will find this helpful.
</I>
	Well, I found that picking a webcam is not easy, as they are
lot's of pitfalls and incompatibilites. I actually picked this webcam
for my brother who is using a Mac. The support of webcam in OS-X is
pretty weird as well.
