<PRE>&gt;<i> I'm also working with cameras on a mobile robot, but unfortunately after
</I>&gt;<i> some experimentation I think I'm ruling out these quickcams because of
</I>&gt;<i> their &quot;rolling shutter&quot; which causes each line of the image to be
</I>&gt;<i> captured at a different moment in time.  It's unfortunate that getting
</I>&gt;<i> anything better than these generally costs at least $1000.
</I>
Indeed. As we only need to detect static objects, we will stop the robot for a 
second to grab images. That's not a perfect solution, I'll ask Logitech if 
they plan to develop a camera with a better sensor.

&gt;<i> I'm half-interested in developing an &quot;open-source&quot; hardware
</I>&gt;<i> implementation for a USB camera.  If you're interested in talking about
</I>&gt;<i> it, I have some ideas for what parts to use.  Parts, PCB, and assembly
</I>&gt;<i> would probably add up to at least $300 each, but would decrease with
</I>&gt;<i> quantity.
</I>
I'm indeed very interested. Can you give me more information ? Have you 
contacted other people ?

&gt;<i> &gt; The driver just does what the webcam asks, so that's a hardware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limitation. I'll contact Logitech to get more information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a contact with a Logitech engineer, I'm also curious if
</I>&gt;<i> there's some hidden &quot;RAW&quot; feature of these cameras to get the raw bayer
</I>&gt;<i> data instead of the interpolated data.  It would be much more bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> efficient to transmit just the raw bayer data over the bus and do the
</I>&gt;<i> interpolation in the application.
</I>
I'll ask them.

&gt;<i> There's also two &quot;mysterious&quot; extension units identified by the USB
</I>&gt;<i> descriptors.  Do you have any idea what they do?
</I>
Those extension units are mostly used for internal purpose (debug, device 
identification, ...). They expose a few interesting controls such as color 
correction for which I still need to implement support in the linux-uvc 
driver.
