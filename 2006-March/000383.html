<PRE>Even on 2.6.12, I had stability problems with my Quickcam Pro 5000.
After poking around, I discovered that many of the USB isochronous
packets were filled with zeros after being passed from kernel to uvc
driver.  About 1 in 8 packets had this problem.  Since the packet header
would also be zeroed, parsing of the stream would loose sync and cause
the whole thing to fail.

Upgrading to 2.6.15 solved it for me.

So it may be a lost cause to try to get it working under 2.6.8.  If
anything, the fact that you have only USB 1.1 might help you, because I
suspect most of the bugs are in the ehci_hcd driver since that has been
tested less than uhci (especially with hi speed iso transfers -- uvc
might be the only driver to ever exercise that functionality).
