I'm also working with cameras on a mobile robot, but unfortunately after
some experimentation I think I'm ruling out these quickcams because of
their &quot;rolling shutter&quot; which causes each line of the image to be
captured at a different moment in time.  It's unfortunate that getting
anything better than these generally costs at least $1000.

I'm half-interested in developing an &quot;open-source&quot; hardware
implementation for a USB camera.  If you're interested in talking about
it, I have some ideas for what parts to use.  Parts, PCB, and assembly
would probably add up to at least $300 each, but would decrease with
quantity.

If you have a contact with a Logitech engineer, I'm also curious if
there's some hidden &quot;RAW&quot; feature of these cameras to get the raw bayer
data instead of the interpolated data.  It would be much more bandwidth
efficient to transmit just the raw bayer data over the bus and do the
interpolation in the application.

There's also two &quot;mysterious&quot; extension units identified by the USB
descriptors.  Do you have any idea what they do?
