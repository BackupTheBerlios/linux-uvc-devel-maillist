<PRE>I'm please to announce the release of a new piece of software for the UVC V4L2 
interface.

<A HREF="http://staticwave.ca/source/uvccapture/uvccapture-0.2.tar.bz2">http://staticwave.ca/source/uvccapture/uvccapture-0.2.tar.bz2</A>

uvccapture is based of luvcview written by Laurent Pinchart &amp; Michel Xhaard.

Essentially what I've done is stripped away all the SDL GUI elements, and 
implemented a timer interface to save JPEG files at a user-specified 
interval.

This is very much a hack, as still image support isn't available from the 
driver, this continuously captures images and writes to a file according to a 
user-specified interval. This eats up lots of CPU, especially if you up the 
default image size. The reason for continuous polling is that it seems as 
soon as the driver is initalized it begins buffering images, and so I have to 
discard the shots otherwise the &quot;write an image every x seconds&quot; becomes 
&quot;write the next frame every x seconds&quot;. The command-line parameter code is 
very primitive, so make sure you pass valid inputs. As noted by the driver 
sourcecode, don't expect to kill this program and run it again, as re-opening 
of the videodevice seems to be buggy.

Bugfixes, enhancements and feature patches are welcome, please test patches, 
as I don't actually have a cam that uses this driver, its been tested 
entirely by a third party for me. (Thanks Ian)

For more info see README in the tarball.
