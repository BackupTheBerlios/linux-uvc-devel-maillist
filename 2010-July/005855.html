I am happy to report that all instances of UVC JPEG corruption on my
platform have been resolved.  There were actually two sources of
corruption, and I was encountering both of them.  This may explain why
debugging was so bewildering.

One form of corruption was due to CPU starvation and not properly handling
lost isochronous packets.  Your patch here:
<A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2010-July/005824.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/linux-uvc-devel/2010-July/005824.html</A>
definitely resolved this for me.

The other form of corruption is less well understood, but it was resolved
by the change I described above.

I have two pathological test cases which triggered these bugs.
Unfortunately, the causes are totally independent, and I was seeing the
&quot;caching bug&quot; when trying your isochronous patch, and thus saw no
improvement.  However, after resolving the &quot;caching bug,&quot; I moved on to a
different test case which revealed corruption again, and here your patch
was the solution.

I would like to ask you to push your patch upstream, and to investigate the
efficacy of mine.  I don't know anything about VMAs, but I know this works
for me.

Thank you very much for your assistance.  I am happy to run further tests
on my platform if you want.

Best Regards
