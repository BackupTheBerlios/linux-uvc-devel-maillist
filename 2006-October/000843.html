<PRE>I need to capture single images at a given interval, however I need them
to be at the full 1.3MP, jpeg and I need to have the camera &quot;go to
sleep&quot; between images.  I may be able to &quot;sleep&quot;, start streaming video,
extract still frame and go back to sleep, yes?  

Upgrading to &gt;= 2.6.15 is going to be difficult on the Cerf board.  That
is why I was back-porting (not easy!).  I'll try my best to upgrade.

Thanks for the help,
Thomas

Hi Thomas,

&gt;<i> I am new to this, so please excuse any noob related wrong doings :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This message is to let you all know what I am going to be doing and my
</I>&gt;<i> current progress.  Any feedback from you will be most appreciated!
</I>
Thanks for the information. This will help us improve the driver.

&gt;<i> I am porting the UVC driver to run on an ARM based Intrinsyc Cerf
</I>Board
&gt;<i> running the 2.6.7 kernel and need to add still image capture
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities.  I already have it compiling and running enough to be
</I>able
&gt;<i> to query the webcam (Quickcam for Notebooks Pro) and change some cam
</I>&gt;<i> settings like brightness, etc.  I am using the user-space application
</I>&gt;<i> videodog for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone wants to know the details of what I had to do to get it to
</I>run
&gt;<i> on that kernel and ARM, I will gladly let you know, simply ask!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, if anyone knows some reason why this is an impossible task,
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know.
</I>
Not impossible, but there are a few known problems.

First, you should upgrade to a 2.6.15 (or newer) kernel. I had USB
issues with 
2.6.12, and upgrading to 2.6.15 solved them. Anything older is not
supported, 
and will likely fail.

Second, the V4L2 API has no still image capture support. Do you really
need 
still image capture in response to button events, or do you only need to

capture single images at a given interval ? In the second case, there
should 
be no problem using the video streaming API. In the first case, V4L2
will 
have to be extended.

&gt;<i> Thank you and keep up the good work,
</I>
Thanks, you're welcome :-)
