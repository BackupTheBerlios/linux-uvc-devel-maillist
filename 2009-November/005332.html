-75 is -EOVERFLOW, which indicates that the device sends too much data 
(babble). The next error, -71, is -EPROTO, which indicates some low-level 
error (bitstuff error, no response received within the bus turn-around time, 
...).

The errors you get are quite low-level. -EOVERFLOW seems to indicate that the 
device sends too much data in a bulk packet. Can you see that with the USB 
analyzer ?
