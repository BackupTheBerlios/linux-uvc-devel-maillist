This sounds like very likely explanation of my different Linux/Windows
experience.

Thanks also for the hint how to hack the driver. Fortunately, I can
avoid hacking the driver as I solved the problem by using two separate
USB controllers. But I'll look to the code just for curiosity... Thanks
anyway for your reply.

Vojtech
&gt;<i> As you've written your own userspace software I assume you're familiar with C

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> USB bandwidth allocation is done in the uvc_init_video() function 
</I>&gt;<i> (uvc_video.c) by a call to usb_set_interface(). You can check which alternate 
</I>&gt;<i> setting the driver requests by printing the value of variable 'i'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A look at the camera's USB descriptors (lsusb -v) will show you a list of 
</I>&gt;<i> alternate settings for the video streaming interface. Each alternate setting 
</I>&gt;<i> has different packet sizes for the isochronous endpoint. Locate the alternate 
</I>&gt;<i> setting with the biggest packet size below the one requested by the driver, 
</I>&gt;<i> and modify uvc_init_video() to hardcode that alternate setting. If that's 
</I>&gt;<i> still too much bandwidth, repeat the procedure until you can start streaming 
</I>&gt;<i> on both cameras.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The driver will then probably get corrupted data (lost packets), but it could 
</I>&gt;<i> be worth a try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW with some new camera models that support MJPG in high resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you should able to squeeze two MJPG <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/linux-uvc-devel">1600x1200 at 10fps</A> video streams from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same usb controller.
