<PRE>Hi,

I have two Logitech Pro9000 cameras. I need to capture images from both
cameras simultaneously. It works perfectly unless I set both cameras to
the highest supported resolution which is 1600x1200 pixels/YUV color
format. Unfortunately, it is exactly the resolution I need in my
application. I tried this in the &quot;luvcview&quot; viewer as well as in
application written by myself which is based on Unicap library. In all
the cases, the behavior is the same: any combination of
resolutions/color formats works perfectly but the one when both cameras
are set to 1600x1200 pixels/YUV format. In this case, the first camera
starts capturing the images, however, the second one rejects to start.
It seems to be a problem on the driver's side.

Does anybody have a similar experience? Could you please advice who is
the author of the particular driver for the Logitech Pro9000 camera so
that I can contact him directly?

Thanks for help,
Vojtech
