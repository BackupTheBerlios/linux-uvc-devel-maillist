<PRE>Hi Laurent,


&gt;<i> sorry for the late reply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 Thats fine.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Laurent,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you for the reply. The webcam  is linux based and I am using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; UVC gadget driver of linux kernel 2.6.10.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this kernel I don't see any example doing UVC bulk transfer. It is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working perfectly with ISOC.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you please let me know, if there is any example code that does UVC
</I>&gt;<i> bulk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer ? I couldn't find it any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UVC gadget driver I wrote uses isochronous transfers. It should be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to use bulk transfers by modifying the driver, but there's no code
</I>&gt;<i> sample that I'm aware of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Does this mean, I have to change the musb gadget driver code? I changed my
driver
which registers with musb. I didn't chane anything on the musb gadget
driver.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The uvc specification is not clear enough to distinguish ISOC and BULK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer atleast from my understanding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While doing ISOC transfer, we have an alternate Interface Setting, when
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get a SET_INTERFACE we start transferring the UVC header first alone to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start the transfer. There after each IN token from host will carry the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; frames if any, otherwise header alone goes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In case of BULK, with alternate settings, the host machine hangs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SET_INTERFACE (alternateSetting set 1), Why is it like that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According to the UVC specification, streaming interfaces with bulk
</I>&gt;<i> endpoints
</I>&gt;<i> don't use alternate settings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is actually a problem, as the UVC specification doesn't provide any
</I>&gt;<i> way
</I>&gt;<i> for bulk devices to detect when the host starts and stops streaming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Do you aware when do I start sending packets to the host? In case of ISOC,
we start sending packets
when get SET_INTERFACE (enabling the alternate setting) request. Please let
me know.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I removed alternate settings and till enumeration it is proper. Then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After I get VS_PROBE_COMMIT from the host, I start transferring exactly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  same like ISOC, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see any video on the host and no more proceedings from here. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data is not going from the FIFO, hence I am not getting any more TX
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interrupt from my device.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am attaching my devices descriptor as well as host side logs. Please
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the attachment. Please let me know, is there any link talk about BULK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transfer or example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The descriptors look correct at first glance. The log shows that the driver
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't receive any bulk packet (assuming the trace parameter has been set
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> 255). This seems to indicate a low-level problem, probably on the device
</I>&gt;<i> side.
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that the device doesn't sent bulk packets. That would be easy
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> verify if you have access to a USB analyzer. If the assumption is correct,
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is on the device side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I see the packets are on the wire. USB Analyzer  shows me the data and even
I verified the header data,
it looks correct, Now I am not getting back the ACK from the host. Thanks
for your Reply.
