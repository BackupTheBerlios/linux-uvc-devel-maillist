URB stands for USB Request Block. See 
<A HREF="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/usb/URB.txt">http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/usb/URB.txt</A> for more information.

You definitely need both URBs and V4L2 buffers, otherwise no data will be 
transferred at all (this will get rid of latency, but probably not the way you 
want it to :-)).

Decreasing the number of URBs or buffers will not reduce latency per se. 
Isochronous URBs (I assume your device uses an isochronous endpoint to stream 
video data) group several isochronous packet transfers. The more packets per 
URB, the bigger the delay between uvcvideo driver video completion callbacks. 
However, this only matters for the last URB of each frame, as the driver has 
to wait until the end of frame before handing it to the application.

For example, when using 32 packets per URB, there can be at most a 31 packets 
delay between the last packet of a frame and the time the completion callback 
is called. This introduces latency.

Lowering the number of packets per URB will reduce latency, but will also eats 
CPU cycles. Make sure you increase the number of URBs if you reduce the number 
of packets, otherwise you might lose packets if the CPU doesn't cope with the 
higher number of interrupts.

Similarly, V4L2 buffers don't introduce latency. They are used to transfer 
video data between the driver and the userspace application in such a way that 
short temporary increases in the userspace processing delay doesn't result in 
frame loss. The buffer queue can, however, hold frames, making latency more 
noticeable if the application can't cope with incoming data fast enough.

As a summary, latency is the sum of

- camera latency
- USB transfer time
- interrupt latency on the host (lowering the number of packets per URB can 
reduce this)
- userspace application latency

The first thing to do, before hacking the driver, is to make sure the 
userspace application is fast enough and can cope with the frame rate. If it 
can't, you could drop a frame from times to times.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
