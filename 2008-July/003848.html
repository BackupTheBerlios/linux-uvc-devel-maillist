</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately this is at the cost of the nice 3D GL support (googleearth

In 1998 you obviously didn't have Skype issues, as there was no Skype at all. 
Just uninstall Skype and you'll get back to your 1998 stability :-)

&gt;<i> If someone has a solution and a proof for the oposite please you're
</I>&gt;<i> welcome. we can move this discussion also to another place as I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> this is the proper place for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you really think this may be a problem? What kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem did you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have and how did you solve them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just change the line in the xorg.conf file
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Driver &quot;nvidia&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> Driver &quot;nv&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be also necessary to change few other things but for me changing
</I>&gt;<i> this line worked, so now video skyping is fine ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Video playback works well in both systems. And I could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; receive the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; video from the remote skype.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it is the same behaviour as I had. If I send skype video  it works and
</I>&gt;<i> If I receive it works too, but as soon as  both parts send skype video it
</I>&gt;<i> breaks - SH...T!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps but I'm getting a little bit angry
</I>
You can't blame Linux as a whole because proprietary software vendors ship 
broken products. That's just not fair.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
