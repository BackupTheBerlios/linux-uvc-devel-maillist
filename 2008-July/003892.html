<PRE>Hi. Laurent and thank you for being kind.

I have different issues that are bugging me. Skype and Webcam is just the smallest one
&gt;<i> It always depends on what you try to achieve. For any given
</I>&gt;<i> OS you will be 
</I>&gt;<i> able to find a task that would be much easier to perform
</I>&gt;<i> under another 
</I>&gt;<i> operating system.
</I>
It seems to be the right answer. But if there has been  something working with my older linux distro and a similar thing is not working on the new one :-(.

My biggest issue is syncing my new mobile phones. As they are buziness phones, provided by the companies I work for I can not influence the model or the producer, so now I'm stuck in a mess of contacts that are different on each phone.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry if you or someone else feel insulted by what I
</I>&gt;<i> said, but also you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not deny the fact that it is not working as it should
</I>&gt;<i> be, because I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evidence that it is not working...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given the amount of e-mails exchanged on this list, I
</I>&gt;<i> won't deny that Skype 
</I>&gt;<i> has issues under Linux. However, blaming Linux for Skype
</I>&gt;<i> issues would be like 
</I>&gt;<i> blaming MS when Firefox crashes.
</I>
Well, in general you are right, but the linux people should be able to do something also about comercial software running on linux itself.
I think what linux laks is a kind of standardized verification routine.
The fact that everybody can change everything is making things differ in minor kernel or compiler versions.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I decided not to use MS years ago I am considering
</I>&gt;<i> buying Apple next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; year.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this is the best solution for me because
</I>&gt;<i> recently I'm pretty buzzy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with my job and familly and I don't have that much
</I>&gt;<i> time to debug linux.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would recommend using linux in home or small
</I>&gt;<i> buziness office solutions as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a server but it's still far from stability as a
</I>&gt;<i> workstation. Some hope
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brings an experiment like EEEC but the future will
</I>&gt;<i> show if this is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; winner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's your opinion, based on your personal background
</I>&gt;<i> and experience. There 
</I>&gt;<i> is no definitive answer regarding how a given operating
</I>&gt;<i> system fits in a 
</I>&gt;<i> given context. There are plenty of people who will find
</I>&gt;<i> Linux much harder to 
</I>&gt;<i> use as a desktop operating system, and there are also
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of people who 
</I>&gt;<i> will find Linux much easier.
</I>
Again, you are may be right, but I've been trying to populate linux under my family and friends and what I do now is trying to find a solution for this stupid issue with Skype video and keep 3D working.
So based on experience, compared to Mac or Windows OS graphicala linux is 
far from being stable and user friendly.

Now this is something else about the gnu community and their compilers. I've got a toy with geode cpu inside and I can not boot a linux kernel. the people from AMD point me to the link where it says kernel 2.6.11 or 2.4.24 with patches from AMD. Now surprise surprise you can compile them only with 2.95 gcc and you don't find this compiler either in SuSE (10.2) which should be kind of stable, nor in recent debian ... and you are preaching ...

and indeed I have a sarge (stable) on one server with gcc-2.95 and the kernel compiles there ... and I tought things should be backwards compatible ... so no way that I completely agree with you, sorry.

Another stupid example:
My father has I Nikon 2100 camera (which appears to be USB1.1) after pluging in the uvcvideo driver and attaching the webcam he can not access the camera. The only solution I found is to make a button on his Desktop which triggers rmmod on uvcvideo and ehci_hcd and kills skype - only to let hinm copy  his images from the camera ... and this is definitely a linux issue.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your opinion and point of view is certainly valid, but is
</I>&gt;<i> also biased, much 
</I>&gt;<i> like all of the other computer users' opinions.
</I>
I agree and I want to have a simple stable system. The only thing I can consider as stable is the stable debian, but it comes on cost of a lot of useful software that is not considered stable - thus I say it's good for a server and not for a simple user desktop.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I appreciate your opinion and the work all of the free
</I>&gt;<i> software community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do - it is very important.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm really sorry speaking so negatively about
</I>&gt;<i> linux in general.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No worries. Just try not to react on the spot when yet
</I>&gt;<i> another small annoyance 
</I>&gt;<i> adds to the pile and makes your brain explode. A good
</I>&gt;<i> night's sleep often 
</I>&gt;<i> helps not to start flame wars.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thanks, I agree, reaction was a bit too emotional, but what you and other folks do are trying to convince me that something is good whe nI say that it is not. So why just not accept the fact that it's a bunch of useful crap, that sometime works and sometime not.
Besides all the issues I have are on kernel level or basic libraries. (except skype of course :-) )1

In few months I hope I'll have more time and I'm considering starting a project that will get a bundle of really working applications and may be get a livecd done.
I think the problem is due to a rapid development with the 2.6 kernel series, so a lot of things can not catch up ... but as you say this is my opinion and I'm tired of filing bugs here and there and spending time on debugging.

In fact and this may be of interest to all of you I have been following a conservative philosophy before (some kind of mixture between debian and gentoo). I took debian stable and compiled and installed every app that I needed. I think I had less troubles then.
Unfortunately the number of nice apps increeses and I'm trying now testing (apt-get install and debug) but as you see I complain more :-)


regards
