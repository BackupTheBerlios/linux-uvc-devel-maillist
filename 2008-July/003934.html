<PRE>Hi Marcel,

first of all, as stated on the quickcamteam.net website, please don't use 
their contact e-mail address for support questions. If you want to post a 
support request, use their forum.

</I>
Some applications paint the video display window to black before starting 
video streaming, so a black window could mean that no image is received by 
the application. This isn't the case here as aiming the camera at light shows 
motion.

I've never encountered a similar issue with Logitech webcams and I can't 
really think of anything on the driver's side that could cause such problems. 
The driver would at least spit an error message to the kernel log if it can't 
read or write a control.

You should post a message to the quickcamteam.net forums. They should have 
more information about Logitech webcam issues than I got.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
