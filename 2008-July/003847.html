Yes, I have exactly the same experience with skype with both ATI and NVidia cards and the commercial drivers.
Basically what happens is that after starting a video conference it slows down and hangs after a while, forcing me to kill and restart skype.
I read that there is a known problem with ATI (a memory leak but don't remember if it was a Skype problem or ATI) also no idea when it will be fixed and at which side.
I don't have access on daily basis to the PC with the ATI card, but I have replaced the Nvidia proprietary driver with the free NV one and skype is working fine.
Unfortunately this is at the cost of the nice 3D GL support (googleearth and other apps are not working), so I am really thinking of buying an Apple PC and solving all of the issues :-( dam it I need few things to work and. As this is not the only thing that's bugging me in linux I'm getting more disappointed, though I really love it.
I've been using it since 1998 and I think it was more simple and more stable at what it claimed to can do.

If someone has a solution and a proof for the oposite please you're welcome. we can move this discussion also to another place as I don't think this is the proper place for it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you really think this may be a problem? What kind of
</I>&gt;<i> problem did you
</I>&gt;<i> have and how did you solve them? 
</I>
Just change the line in the xorg.conf file

Driver &quot;nvidia&quot; to
Driver &quot;nv&quot;

It might be also necessary to change few other things but for me changing this line worked, so now video skyping is fine ;-)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Video playback works well in both systems. And I could
</I>&gt;<i> receive the
</I>&gt;<i> video from the remote skype.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes it is the same behaviour as I had. If I send skype video  it works and If I receive it works too, but as soon as  both parts send skype video it breaks - SH...T! 

Hope this helps but I'm getting a little bit angry 


regards
