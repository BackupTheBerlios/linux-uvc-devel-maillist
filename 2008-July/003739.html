The latest mplayer version should include the patch, but you might have to 
check it out from their SVN repository. I don't know if they released an 
official version with the patch included.

&gt;<i> So may be it's not only the format (i.e. YUV) but also another issue how

</I>
To work the UVC webcams, application have to support V4L2 and at least one of 
the formats supported by the camera (YUV and/or MJPEG). Some application 
still support V4L1 only (vlc felt in that category last time I checked) or 
have bugs in their V4L2 implementation (xawtv and mplayer, before the patch 
got included).

&gt;<i> I hope this info was some kind helpful to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also want to ask you to help me with the issues I stated in my other mail
</I>&gt;<i> if possible
</I>
I can't really help there as I don't use Skype, sorry.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
