<PRE>


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a Google Summer of Code project to add voice
</I>&gt;<i> and video chat support 
</I>&gt;<i> for Jabber in Kopete. In a few months that might become an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative :-)
</I>
It sounds good and reasonable the question is how we can convince users (and mere windows users) to use Jabber or equivalent on Windows instead Skype. I know many of them pay to use the SIP function. Until everything is setup we can wait for another  few years, so I would really like to know if somebody is using following combination of software/hardware.

1) ATI/NVidia + proprietary driver
2) 3D
3) Skype
4) UVC webcam

More precisely
ATI Mobility Radeon X600
NVidia GeForce4 460
Philips SPC1000 
Philips SPC620/NC
OS: Debian or SuSE

I'm really in a big trouble as it is kind of compromising and disappointing in the same time.
They do what I tell them so I tell them 3D is good and they see it and like it.
I tell them you could use webcam buy SPC1000 or SPC620 they buy and it is not working. I tell them you have to give up 3D and they get turn the smily upside down like this :-(
We leave the political discussion aside how bad proprietary dangerous is, and I have only something that is not working and should work. 

I'm trying to get this confirmed to file a bug somewhere and hope to get it solved. Think it's known problem for ATI but may be tehre is somewhere around a working xorg.conf

Any way thanks and regards
