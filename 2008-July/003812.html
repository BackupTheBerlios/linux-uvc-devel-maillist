</I>
Your webcam module is made of two chipsets, a CMOS sensor and a USB bridge. 
The sensor, an OV9655, is controlled by the USB bridge firmware through its 
I2C interface.

With pre-UVC bridges, I2C registers were configured by the driver on the host. 
Flipping the image, if supported by the sensor, was quite easy provided you 
have the bridge and sensor documentation.

UVC brought a new standardised interface on the USB side, and the sensor is 
now configured by the firmware running on the bridge. There is no standard 
way to access the I2C bus from the host. To make specific sensor features 
configurable by the driver, the firmware has to implement an extension unit 
with proprietary controls and map those controls to I2C register operations. 
For instance, a firmware could implement a vertical flip and an horizontal 
flip control, and write the appropriate values to the sensor's I2C registers. 
Even though this model seems more complex, it makes sense to abstracts the 
sensor behind an extension unit so that only the firmware has to care about 
sensor-specific information. The host driver sees functions, the firmware 
translate between those functions and the low-level, vendor-specific 
commands.

Sonix predefined two extension units in their firmware SDK called XU1 and XU2. 
Their GUID are

{0x28f03370, 0x6311, 0x4a2e, {0xba, 0x2c, 0x68, 0x90, 0xeb, 0x33, 0x40, 0x16}}
{0x2812ae3f, 0xbcd7, 0x4e11, {0xa3, 0x57, 0x6f, 0x1e, 0xde, 0xf7, 0xd6, 0x1d}}

XU1 implements 5 controls to read and write from ASIC registers, I2C 
registers, serial flash and runtime variables, and to read from the internal 
ROM.

XU2 implements up to 8 controls that can be used by module vendors through 
custom firmware modifications.

Sonix ships a default firmware that doesn't support XU2. Many webcam modules 
vendors don't bother adding extra functions and ship their device with that 
default firmware. If you look at the lsusb -v output for your camera you will 
notice that only XU1 is implemented, so the vendor didn't explicitly provide 
a way to access the vertical and horizontal flip functions.

Even though XU1 can be used to read and write I2C registers, that control is 
often not implemented, or at least not exposed, by the firmware. The 
bmControls field in the extension unit is a bitmask that list the supported 
controls. The individual bits, from left to right, are

7-5	Reserved
4	Runtime variables read/write
3	Internal ROM read
2	Serial flash read/write
1	I2C read/write
0	ASIC registers read/write

Your camera has bmControls set to 0x01, which means the I2C read/write control 
is marked as supported. However, it might still be supported in the firmware 
but marked as unsupported so that applications will not try to access it.

Even if the I2C read/write control is not available, it might still be 
possible to access the I2C bus through the ASIC registers. Unfortunately, the 
I2C-related ASIC registers are not documented, but it might be possible to 
reverse-engineer the binary-only firmware to gather information about those 
registers. Another option, of course, would be to ask Sonix for more 
information.

I would personally try the I2C read/write control first, even if the camera 
claims not to implement it.

To read an I2C register, you will first have to issue a SET_CUR query followed 
by a GET_CUR query.

The I2C read/write control is 8 bytes long. Here is how Sonix documents it.

SET_CUR

   Index Field Name  Description
   0x00  SlaveID     I2C slave ID
   0x01  Length      Number of bytes to read/write to the I2C slave
   0x02  Data0       I2C data field 0 (I2C slave sub-address)
   0x03  Data1       I2C data field 1
   0x04  Data2       I2C data field 2
   0x05  Data3       I2C data field 3
   0x06  Data4       I2C data field 4
   0x07  Dummy       0x00: write
                     0xff: read

GET_CUR

   Index Field Name  Description
   0x00  SlaveID     I2C slave ID
   0x01  Length      Number of bytes issued by SET_CUR
   0x02  Data0       Data 0 issued by SET_CUR
   0x03  Data1       Retrieved I2C data field 0
   0x04  Data2       Retrieved I2C data field 1
   0x05  Data3       Retrieved I2C data field 2
   0x06  Data4       Retrieved I2C data field 3
   0x07  Fixed       0x00

I have no other information so you will probably have to experiment a bit. For 
instance I don't know if the I2C slave ID is the 8-bit device address (60 for 
write, 61 for read - or is it 0x60 and 0x61 ?) or the 7-bit device address 
(30 or 0x30). I'm also not sure what the length field should be set to in the 
SET_CUR command. For a 8-bit register read I would guess it should be set to 
1.

Could you try to tweak the driver to read the PID and VER OV9655 registers and 
see how the camera behaves ?

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
