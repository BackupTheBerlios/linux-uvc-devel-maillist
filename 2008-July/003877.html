It always depends on what you try to achieve. For any given OS you will be 
able to find a task that would be much easier to perform under another 
operating system.

</I>
Given the amount of e-mails exchanged on this list, I won't deny that Skype 
has issues under Linux. However, blaming Linux for Skype issues would be like 
blaming MS when Firefox crashes.

&gt;<i> As I decided not to use MS years ago I am considering buying Apple next

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is the best solution for me because recently I'm pretty buzzy

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
That's your opinion, based on your personal background and experience. There 
is no definitive answer regarding how a given operating system fits in a 
given context. There are plenty of people who will find Linux much harder to 
use as a desktop operating system, and there are also plenty of people who 
will find Linux much easier.

Your opinion and point of view is certainly valid, but is also biased, much 
like all of the other computer users' opinions.

&gt;<i> I appreciate your opinion and the work all of the free software community
</I>&gt;<i> do - it is very important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really sorry speaking so negatively about linux in general.
</I>
No worries. Just try not to react on the spot when yet another small annoyance 
adds to the pile and makes your brain explode. A good night's sleep often 
helps not to start flame wars.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
