<PRE>Hello, I know that may be this is the wrong place  to post the question, but I hope and think that many of you are using your cams with Skype on different hardware and can help me solve the problems we have. I'm also sorry that this posting got a little bit long.

1) This is not a problem but a statement. I have SPC1000 and it is working flowlessly with two monitors on intel 945GM/GMS chipset without drm/dri, because intel does not support the drm. I don't think this is the reason for the following 2 problems.

2) Problem 1: My father has a Toshiba Satellite with NVidia GeForce4 460. I installed linux few years aago (SuSE) and he's pretty happy with it, but I have to support it because he is a mere user. Proprietary nvidia driver works fine with it but Skype does not. I tested it with the nv driver and it works great. With the nvidia either I can see him or he can sees me, but as soon as we both switch on our webcams the image freezes and speech get's broken and finally lost.

The Question: Is there someone who uses nvidia proprietary (especially with this video card model) and with the uvc driver (especially with this webcam model)? 

Does someone has a good xorg.conf setting for this issue or other work around?

I'm lost so thanks

3) A friend (it's she) has a notebook with  ATI Mobility Radeon X600. I installed there debian years ago and she likes it very much. It works fine with the fglrx proprietary but Skype with the same cam SPC620NC does not.
I read that there is a memory leak or similar in Skype and tried to put a question in their mailing list for possible solution, but didn't get an answer. 

The Question: Is there someone who uses ati proprietary (especially with this video card model) and with the uvc driver (especially with this webcam model)? 

Does someone has a good xorg.conf setting for this issue or other work around?

General Questions:
Is it the dri/drm or what could be the problem ? I spent a lot of time making this xorg.conf's but it was time ago, so who knows.
I don't think it is the webcam, because the SPC1000 does not make the things better, so this is something beween Skype and the propriuetary drivers and X. So is there someone, who has had same problems and solved them and how if so?

It would be very kind if you could help, because they are bugging me all the time. And I think they are right and it's a pitty if they have to give up the quality that comes with the proprietary drivers. The nv is not that big issue but free ati looks crappy on the notebook and makes alot of troubles.

Thanks in advance
