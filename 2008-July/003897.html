</I>
It means the camera failed to answer a GET_DEF(135) and GET_MIN(130) query on 
the brightness (2, unit 2) and saturation (7, unit 2) controls with a timeout 
(-110) and an explicit USB error (-32). Why the camera failed to answer the 
requests is not clear, but this should not happen. As the driver sends valid 
requests I would guess the camera has a firmware bug, probably 
timing-related.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm afraid there's not much I can do at this point. Only Logitech could

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mmh, ok. Thanks. I maybe give it a try to contact Logitech. I don't expect

</I>
Try to contact them through the www.quickcamteam.net forums.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently the rule is only triggered when rmmod/insmod the module. I have a

</I>
I'm no udev expert so I can't help you on this one. If nobody can help you 
here you could try your luck on the www.quickcamteam.net forums.

&gt;<i> And can one point me to some infos of what has changed in the controls? I
</I>&gt;<i> want to patch motion to support the new controls. Thanks!
</I>
Before the &quot;dynamic controls&quot; were introduced in the driver, uvcvideo exported 
a single control to control pan and tilt. The 16 MSB stored the pan value and 
the 16 LSB stored the tilt value (it could be the opposite). With the 
introduction of dynamic controls, the uvcdynctrl configures the driver at 
runtime with vendor-specific controls. Pan and tilt are now handled as two 
separate controls, V4L2_CID_PAN_RELATIVE and V4L2_CID_TILT_RELATIVE. Their 
values have been added to linux/videodev2.h in 2.6.26.

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
