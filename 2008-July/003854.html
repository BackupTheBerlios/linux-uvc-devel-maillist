<PRE>Dear Laurent,

I appreciate your opinion and you are right in what you say. I am also aware of the problems with proprietary software and I don't blame anybody.

I'm also very thankful to you and people like who make things work under linux. I have helped and still help a lot to improve (debug, develop) software working under linux but it is obvious that a lot of stuff still is not working

It just sucks that I can not do few simple things and that makes me angry.

I was very optimistic then back in 1998 about linux but it all turns to be more or less a OS for servers and home experiments, because compared to cemercial OS like the stupid MS and OS X I'm spending more time in such community forums as doing things with my pc - I mean I'm more buzy with debugging than using the OS...

Sorry if you or someone else feel insulted by what I said, but also you can not deny the fact that it is not working as it should be, because I have evidence that it is not working...

As I decided not to use MS years ago I am considering buying Apple next year.

I think this is the best solution for me because recently I'm pretty buzzy with my job and familly and I don't have that much time to debug linux.

I would recommend using linux in home or small buziness office solutions as a server but it's still far from stability as a workstation.
Some hope brings an experiment like EEEC but the future will show if this is a winner.

I appreciate your opinion and the work all of the free software community do - it is very important.

I'm really sorry speaking so negatively about linux in general.

kind regards

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; related to my similar problem using ATI or
</I>&gt;<i> NVidia
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; proprietary drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; An Nvidia Gforce2 on one system and a ATI card on
</I>&gt;<i> the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Both with commercial OpenGL enabled drivers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I have exactly the same experience with skype
</I>&gt;<i> with both ATI and NVidia
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cards and the commercial drivers. Basically what
</I>&gt;<i> happens is that after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; starting a video conference it slows down and hangs
</I>&gt;<i> after a while, forcing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me to kill and restart skype. I read that there is a
</I>&gt;<i> known problem with ATI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a memory leak but don't remember if it was a
</I>&gt;<i> Skype problem or ATI) also no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea when it will be fixed and at which side. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have access on daily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basis to the PC with the ATI card, but I have replaced
</I>&gt;<i> the Nvidia
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proprietary driver with the free NV one and skype is
</I>&gt;<i> working fine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately this is at the cost of the nice 3D GL
</I>&gt;<i> support (googleearth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and other apps are not working), so I am really
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of buying an Apple
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PC and solving all of the issues :-( dam it I need few
</I>&gt;<i> things to work and.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As this is not the only thing that's bugging me in
</I>&gt;<i> linux I'm getting more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disappointed, though I really love it. I've been
</I>&gt;<i> using it since 1998 and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think it was more simple and more stable at what it
</I>&gt;<i> claimed to can do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In 1998 you obviously didn't have Skype issues, as
</I>&gt;<i> there was no Skype at all. 
</I>&gt;<i> Just uninstall Skype and you'll get back to your 1998
</I>&gt;<i> stability :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If someone has a solution and a proof for the oposite
</I>&gt;<i> please you're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; welcome. we can move this discussion also to another
</I>&gt;<i> place as I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is the proper place for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do you really think this may be a problem? What
</I>&gt;<i> kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; problem did you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have and how did you solve them?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just change the line in the xorg.conf file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Driver &quot;nvidia&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Driver &quot;nv&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It might be also necessary to change few other things
</I>&gt;<i> but for me changing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this line worked, so now video skyping is fine ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Video playback works well in both systems. And I
</I>&gt;<i> could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; receive the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; video from the remote skype.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes it is the same behaviour as I had. If I send skype
</I>&gt;<i> video  it works and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I receive it works too, but as soon as  both parts
</I>&gt;<i> send skype video it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breaks - SH...T!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hope this helps but I'm getting a little bit angry
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can't blame Linux as a whole because proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> software vendors ship 
</I>&gt;<i> broken products. That's just not fair.
</I>&gt;<i>
