<PRE>Hi, thanks for answering.

I don't have time for compiling mplayer now, and I don't really need it because all I want is to speak over Skype with my family and my friends and this is working for me.

I know this but no time to do it

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So may be it's not only the format (i.e. YUV) but
</I>&gt;<i> also another issue how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device and data is handled by the app itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To work the UVC webcams, application have to support V4L2
</I>&gt;<i> and at least one of 
</I>&gt;<i> the formats supported by the camera (YUV and/or MJPEG).
</I>&gt;<i> Some application 
</I>&gt;<i> still support V4L1 only (vlc felt in that category last
</I>&gt;<i> time I checked) or 
</I>&gt;<i> have bugs in their V4L2 implementation (xawtv and mplayer,
</I>&gt;<i> before the patch 
</I>&gt;<i> got included).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I know this but I don't have a real problem with the webcam or Skype

&gt;<i> I can't really help there as I don't use Skype,
</I>&gt;<i> sorry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Could somebody have a look at my mail to the list with the Title [Question uvc Philps SPC620NC nvidia,ati and Skype] that I posted on 7/3/2008

I really would appreciate your help.

thanks
