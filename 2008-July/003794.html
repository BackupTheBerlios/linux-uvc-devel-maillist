<PRE>Hello list people :)

i have been posting about some issues i had a couple of monthes ago.
The company i'm working for was in the need of a system with 5  
webcams, able to shoot simultaneously &quot;objects&quot; from 5 different POVs.  
The generated pictures are then used for 3D modeling.

Big problem, the &quot;object&quot; is a horse, so the total time of shooting  
has to be around 10 seconds, not more, because holding a horse still  
for more than 10 seconds require super powers, which we don't have (Or  
are too expensive, i dont know) :)

So we bought 5 quickcam 9000 pro, since the required resolution to  
have a find 3D mesh is 1600x1200.

Actually, all the webcams are wired to a single USB hub, and a little  
application i have coded handles a very simple queue when the user  
presses the &quot;shoot&quot; button.
The application simply calls the uvccapture command, waits for it to  
finish, stores the result, and starts uvccapture on the next camera (/ 
dev/video0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4) and so on.

The task takes around 18 seconds it's a bit too much.

So i was wondering... Why not to use two USB hubs to wire the cameras,  
3 cameras on the first hub, two on the second, so the application will  
be able to shoot two cams at the same time, then again, then the one  
remaining?

So today i coded this workflow on my application, /dev/video0 to /dev/ 
video2 on the first hub, /dev/video3 and /dev/video4 on the other.
The goal was to shoot video0 / video 3 at the same time, then video1 /  
video4 at the same time, then /dev/video3.
And i was very surprised to see that the system doesn't allows me  
simultaneous requests to the driver.

Is there any solution to that?

Thanks for your time!
Pierre.
