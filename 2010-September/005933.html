The UVC driver does not support still images, but if you select a frame
rate low enough, exposure time will be larger.

Unfortunately, it seems that few cameras allow frame rates _below_ 5
FPS. Logitech only lists the _max_ frame rate in their specs, but their
happens to be discussion on the C910 in their forums with a dump from
guvcview (this is the kind of info we'd love from every cam!):
<A HREF="http://forums.quickcamteam.net/showthread.php?tid=1345&amp;pid=4976#pid4976">http://forums.quickcamteam.net/showthread.php?tid=1345&amp;pid=4976#pid4976</A>

See, nothing below 5 FPS.

For your kind of application, I would almost recommend getting a
cheap and/or used digital camera and controlling it with gphoto2.
(My guess is you will also get more and perhaps better megapixels for
the same price, unless you need an additional mini-tripod.)

I'm saying &quot;almost&quot; because:
  a) I have never owned a camera where this gphoto2 mode was
     supported. I haven't tried my wife's old IXUS 70 yet though,
     it should work. Let me mark that as something to try on a rainy
     weekend.
  b) I don't know how to set exposure and focus, let alone zoom.
     According to
     <A HREF="http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/47498-sophisticated-picture-taking-with-gphoto">http://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/47498-sophisticated-picture-taking-with-gphoto</A>
     &quot;Focus, aperture, and other settings will need to be set before
     taking any shots.&quot; Fair enough. I guess you could always use
     auto-exposure.

I hope this helps, at least to find a path to a different solution.
