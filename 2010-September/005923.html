<PRE>Hello,

I'm using an Omnivision test kit that uses an OV538 controller and an
OV9712 chip (vid:pid 05A9:8065), for which no uvc driver exists - I'm
trying to avoid reinventing the wheel, and so want to find a driver to
modify that has been written for as similar a model as possible.

I believe that the Microsoft Lifecam Cinema HD (045e:075d) uses
similar hardware, and it is supposedly (at least partially)
UVC-compliant. However, looking through the source code that I just
grabbed (from <A HREF="git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/uvcvideo.git">git://linuxtv.org/pinchartl/uvcvideo.git</A>), it looks like
the Lifecam Cinema should be listed in
(uvcvideo/drivers/media/video/uvc/) uvc_driver.c. However,
uvc_driver.c only mentions two previous types of lifecams (NX6000 and
VX7000). Further, no files in the entire source code directory contain
any other mention of lifecams, or reference to the Lifecam Cinema's
product ID (075d). I believe that by simply changing/adding the vendor
ID and product ID in the right place in the source code, I can make
the driver work for my hardware - but the ID's are nowhere to be
found! Can anyone out there help? Where should I be going to find the
Lifecam Cinema-specific driver in the source code?

If for some reason the Lifecam Cinema isn't actually supported (or
ends up not working with my test kit anyway), and I have to start a
new driver from scratch, are there any helpful pointers about how to
best approach this?

(And I would be eternally grateful to anyone that may already have a
driver set up for an identical Omnivision test kit)

Thanks,
Will

</PRE>
