<PRE>Hello everybody,

since the topic of still image support has come up time and again, I've
decided to give it a shot. After reading the UVC spec, it seems that
there isn't too much difference to the normal operation, so I created a
new set of functions from uvc_probe_video, uvc_commit_video and friends.
These are called uvc_probe_still, uvc_commit_still and additionally
uvc_trigger_still.

Just for testing, I replaced the original functions with calls to the
still image functions and got somewhat mixed results with my two cams:

- the builtin camera in my Lenovo netbook doesn't really behave any
different, it still streams images as before

- my Quickcam S5500 doesn't do anything, guvcview complains:
 Could not grab image (select timeout): Resource temporarily unavailable

I'm aware that this is a really ugly hack right now, but maybe it
provides a starting point for those of you with more insight into how
the driver works. I'd be glad for some hints as to how to proceed!

Thanks
Florian

P.S. The relevant parts from the UVC spec are:

Spec:
  2.4.2.4 Still Image Capture
  4.3.1.2 Video Still Probe/Commit Control
  4.3.1.4 Still Image Trigger Control

FAQ:
  2.30 Still Image Transfer
