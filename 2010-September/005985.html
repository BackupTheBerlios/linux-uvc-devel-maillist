Good questions...

How many user applications support 'multiple open' and 'channel selection'?

Perhaps creating a new video node is the more user friendly way to
go?... With a snapshot image repeatedly given until a new snapshot image
is acquired?

</I>
For my example usage, I'm deliberately wanting the live video stream to
be *not* active at all.

For the case where there is a live video stream that must be stopped
temporarily, then perhaps the last video image could be repeated until
the stream can be automatically reactivated again? Also, with the last
settings maintained? Hence, such a transition will be transparent to the
user application.


Regards,
Martin
