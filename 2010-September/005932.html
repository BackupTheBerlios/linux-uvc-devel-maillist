<PRE>Hi everyone,

This may not be most appropriate place to ask, because the UVC device I'm
building (custom hardware) actually seems to be working pretty well under
linux, I'm getting a nice steady 25fps PAL picture. I just feel there's a
lot of expertise here that someone may be able to assist. 

The problem is my hardware under windows only gets ~10-12fps, and I need
cross platform compatibility. It doesn't report any dropped frames, and it
gets this speed no matter which renderer I use. 

I don't think the problem is the pc, as I've tried it on a couple of
different windows boxes and the working linux is in a vmware instance on the
same pc anyway.

 

I feel there must be something wrong in my uvc descriptors / setup that is
confusing the windows driver where the linux one is more forgiving. I've
tried playing with the mix/max bitrates, and continuous vs static frame
intervals, all to no avail. 

 

I've also added timestamps to my frames (uncompressed yuy2) which I think
are working, but also noticed no difference.

Is there any way with the linux driver to check the frame timestamps, if
they're wrong it should show up as late/missed frames?

 

Has anyone got any suggestions? I really want to ensure my hardware is going
to be stable on as wide a range of computers as possible.

 

Thanks,

Andrew
