Still image capture won't bring exposure control.

In theory, auto-exposure will modify the frame rate according to the light 
conditions and can lower the frame rate. It should never push the frame rate 
higher than the selected value.

&gt;<i> I do _not_ know whether a constant FPS and disabled autoexposure would
</I>&gt;<i> lead to under-/overexposure but defined exposure time.
</I>
The UVC specification isn't very clear on the subject. It states that &quot;[...] 
the manual exposure control is further limited by the frame interval, which 
always has higher precedence.&quot;

My understanding is that disabling auto-exposure and setting the exposure time 
manually should work when the requested exposure time is lower than the frame 
interval. The specificat

In practice I expect most webcams not to bother about this and honor the 
requested exposure time. I've just tested an old Logitech camera and it seems 
to work that way (although the exposure time values seem broken, a lower value 
corresponds to a higher exposure time).

&gt;<i> &gt; Well, this is exactly the solution I am using right now :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ha! :-) But you have valid points there. No mechanical wear in the web
