</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good questions...

</I>
Not many. As there's no still image capture API at the moment, I don't think 
any application supports still image capture :-)

&gt;<i> Perhaps creating a new video node is the more user friendly way to
</I>&gt;<i> go?... With a snapshot image repeatedly given until a new snapshot image
</I>&gt;<i> is acquired?
</I>
I think all this should be discussed in the linux-media mailing list. A still 
image capture API could be useful for other devices as well.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm really open to suggestions here. We also need to remember that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capturing a still image with method 2 (unlike method 3) will stop the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; live video stream for a brief time. Is that acceptable ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For my example usage, I'm deliberately wanting the live video stream to
</I>&gt;<i> be *not* active at all.
</I>
I wonder if that would work. The UVC specification states that method 2 
interrupts the live video stream. This implies the existence of a live video 
stream :-) There's probably nothing in practice that prevents method 2 from 
working without a live video stream, but it's a bit of a grey area, and there 
could be device bugs.

&gt;<i> For the case where there is a live video stream that must be stopped
</I>&gt;<i> temporarily, then perhaps the last video image could be repeated until
</I>&gt;<i> the stream can be automatically reactivated again? Also, with the last
</I>&gt;<i> settings maintained? Hence, such a transition will be transparent to the
</I>&gt;<i> user application.
</I>
