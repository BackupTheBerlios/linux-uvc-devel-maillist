<PRE>Hi Florian,

Thanks for the patch.

The patch looks good to me, except of course that it's a hack :-)

The real question we need to answer is how to expose the still image capture 
function to userspace. Should a new video node be created for still image 
capture ? The new video node could be linked to the existing one using the 
media controller API. Or should we use multiple open on a single video node ? 
In that case, how would we select video/still image capture ?

I'm really open to suggestions here. We also need to remember that capturing a 
still image with method 2 (unlike method 3) will stop the live video stream 
for a brief time. Is that acceptable ?

Laurent Pinchart
