<PRE>Hi,

Good question. I have no understanding of the UVC standard, I only know
the still image buzzword from many threads here. :)

You're right, I missed that. It does say 1/2 (that's SPF, not FPS, by
the way).

My experience - without having done _anything_ with re-adjusting
autoexposure or the likes - is that the camera will expose as much of
that interval if it needs to. But since it doesn't have an aperture, it
reduces exposure time in better lighting. One of my personal webcam
(non-UVC) installations is at constant 5 FPS, but only in the evening
does movement appear blurry in the stream.

I do _not_ know whether a constant FPS and disabled autoexposure would
lead to under-/overexposure but defined exposure time.

&gt;<i> Well, this is exactly the solution I am using right now :-)
</I>
Ha! :-) But you have valid points there. No mechanical wear in the web
cam. (But my web cam's sensor seems to have deteriorated over the
years.)
