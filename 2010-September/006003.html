I think this should be discussed on the linux-media mailing list. We're 
creating a still image capture API (or at least an interpretation of the V4L 
API on how to capture still images), developers of other drivers could be 
interested.

Can you start a mail thread on the linux-media mailing list ? I can do it as 
well but probably not before this weekend.

&gt;<i> BTW, if the new node would be just a link, how would the driver know
</I>&gt;<i> about it?
</I>
What do you mean by a link ?

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm really open to suggestions here. We also need to remember that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capturing a still image with method 2 (unlike method 3) will stop the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; live video stream for a brief time. Is that acceptable ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think so, it's acceptable that one video camera can only be used by one
</I>&gt;<i> application at a time (which would otherwise probably trigger all kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> interference anyway).
