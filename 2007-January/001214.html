I tend to agree: At least when I was hacking on the ofvx2 driver for the
iBot2 camera, the first thing I did was to remove the I2C abstraction,
because a good half of the settings of the _sensor_ needed to be
different for the bridge I was working with.

That, and the bridge didn't implement full I2C controller either, just a
small subset of the functions.

Yes, it still possible to make the sensor drivers generic enough to be
able to encompass all the bridge chip needs, with different mode
settings, etc, but I'm not sure if that's a benefit in the end, when
a sensor driver is just a thing that puts a list of numbers into a list
of registers.

</I>
Actually, for vendor-specific obscure encoding modes it does make sense.
Yes, V4L2 is built around the fact that no processing is done on the
actual data, but then, this is a huge pain with all the applications
having to support every quirk of every device.

And, in many cases, the driver ends up having to COPY the data from the
USB transfer buffers to the application buffers. It doesn't cost much to
do a simple transformation on top of the copy, in the same way that
copy_and_checksum is nearly as fast as just a copy.

Btw, I would like to ask driver writers to really think for a while and
consider how many copies of the video stream need to be made before it
reaches the userspace application. In many cases I believe the number
can be zero.
