<PRE>Hi Gerald,

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     If I were inclined to fund development of the &quot;linux-uvc&quot; driver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with respect to some particular camera model....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... that would be greatly appreciated :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     How much money would be reasonably required in order to have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; necessary changes patched to support the particular camera model?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That would depend on the particular features the camera provides. Could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you provide me with more details at this point ? Would it be a camera
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with standard features, or would it have exotic capabilities ? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particularly concerned by how the features would fit the current v4l2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; API.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you could give me a broad overview of the project, I'll provide you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with pricing information. Feel free to contact me in provide for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well....it's a little amorphous at this point. I'm looking at deploying
</I>&gt;<i> about 300 WebCams with feature set much like the Logitech QuickCam Pro 5000.
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing exotic. We're intending to use them for Jewelry photography for
</I>&gt;<i> tracking purposes. 
</I>
I assume the cameras will be UVC compliant. If that's the case, they might 
work out of the box, without any driver modification. Adding support for 
custom controls (through extension units) isn't difficult.

&gt;<i> We're using Ubuntu 6.10 (Stock Kernel). I intend to create semi-custom
</I>&gt;<i> software suited to our use cases that integrates with our current systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Most likely using Python and GStreamer.
</I>
The GStreamer V4L2 plugin is listed as a 'bad' plugin. Not that the plugin is 
unusable, but it could have a few bugs or issues that you might have to fix. 
Nothing difficult though.

&gt;<i> Pretty much, I just need to know what sort of possibilities there will
</I>&gt;<i> be for supporting newer Camera models in the near future.
</I>
For UVC-compliant models without exotic features, you really don't have to 
worry. More exotic features, such as loops in the UVC units chain, would be 
more difficult to support, but I doubt any webcam will require that in the 
near future.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     I would supply the Camera for free as well as fund the testing and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; development.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     I'm not looking for any sort or precise commitment at this point, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; only would like to know if this is an option should I, or actually the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; company I work for, need a particular UVC Camera Model to function in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the near future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that's definitely an option. I'd be happy to help you with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the Feedback and thanks for all the work you've done so far
</I>&gt;<i> on the UVC drivers!
</I>
You're welcome :-)

Best regards,

Laurent Pinchart
