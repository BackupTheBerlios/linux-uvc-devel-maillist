<PRE>
Laurent,

&lt;SNIP&gt;
&gt;&gt;<i> Yes the computer is still working, it is only the camera that locks up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like I mentioned many times before, Logitech webcams are quite sensitive to 
</I>&gt;<i> USB timings. They work fine for some people, mostly fine for other, or even 
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes not at all. Martin Rubli and I tried to fix the issue, or at least 
</I>&gt;<i> find a workaround. 
</I>Yes, I have been following that discussion

&gt;<i>The only thing we found is that there is a hardware bug in 
</I>&gt;<i> the webcams for which no workaround exists today.
</I>That is the definitive statement that I had not understood.

&gt;<i> New generation webcams will 
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully be tested with the Linux UVC driver, and should include a firmware 
</I>&gt;<i> workaround. Unfortunately, on the PC side, there's not much we can do. I 
</I>&gt;<i> stopped working on the problem a few weeks ago. There will probably be no fix 
</I>&gt;<i> unless Logitech decides to put enough man-power on the project to really find 
</I>&gt;<i> out what happens and why Windows doesn't trigger the bug.
</I>Disappointing, can firmware be uploaded to webcams?

&gt;<i> In the meantime, 
</I>&gt;<i> you can consider your webcam broken when connected to your specific computer. 
</I>&gt;<i> It might work fine with another USB controller or another computer (even 
</I>&gt;<i> changing the CPU clock could influence the webcam behaviour).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>My webcam appears to be working fine, I have tested it by leaving it
running for extended periods. The only thing that 'seems' to trigger the
problem is if I stop and start it several times.

As I mentioned in an email my camera is not in a production environment
so if you send me the svn instruction I am happy to test things for you.

Thanks for the driver,
Brian
