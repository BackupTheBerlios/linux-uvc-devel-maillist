That's quite strange: My kopete sources do know some PIXELFORMAT_YUYV.
(0.12.2 and svn, revision 621573 after svn update in directory
libkopete/avdevice)

And by playing around with it, there's one thing I found out:

I first set the camera to YUYV-mode (using some program working and
chosing a high resolution, high resolutions are being worked on as YUYV,
lo resolutions are sent as MJPEG). Then I stopped this other program
(luvcview, iirc) and started kopete. In the configuration dialog
displayed the upper half of a picture (the window was much too small).
AND this picture seemed to have the right colours and be correct.

So I assume, YUYV is supported at the moment. But it is not small enough
to fit in the webcam-assumptions. ;-)

&gt;<i> With some fiddling, it was very easy to add YUYV in kopete and actually I have 
</I>&gt;<i> a patch that works, except that the colors are wrong (almost grayscale, my 
</I>&gt;<i> YUYV color decoding code must be wrong). I added hooks for MJPEG, but 
</I>&gt;<i> actually I have no MJPEG decoder. If someone can give me an example code for 
</I>&gt;<i> MJPEG decoding, I would be glad to release an kopete patch for MJPEG support.
</I>
I want to thank you for your work and time you invest in this project.
By now I do not know some examples. I'll mail again when I find some.

&gt;<i> vloopback is V4L1 only. It is not likely to work with linux-uvc.
</I>
My intention was reading by some daemon program, rewriting the stream,
putting it back in v4l1, then reread via kopete or something. Well, it
would have been a quick solution, nonetheless it's not worth any more
investigation I think.

Have a nice day,

Martin
