Yes, and port all the applications to it. Not a small effort. Still the
raw+library approach doesn't convince me entirely. ALSA has used it, and
still a lot of people prefer the legacy /dev/dsp interface.

The reason being that too much of the complexity is still visible.

&gt;<i> &gt; And, in many cases, the driver ends up having to COPY the data from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the USB transfer buffers to the application buffers. It doesn't cost

I'm all for forcing a couple of sane formats onto userspace, MJPEG,
MPEG, RGB24, Bayer and some of the YUV formats fitting that description.
But I don't think hardware-specific compression schemes make sense to
export to userspace.

These compression schemes will change with further revisions of the
bridges, and it's a pain enough to have to update the kernel driver,
adding the need to update the library (or, worse, all applications),
doesn't make sense IMO.

&gt;<i> &gt; Btw, I would like to ask driver writers to really think for a while
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and consider how many copies of the video stream need to be made
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before it reaches the userspace application. In many cases I believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the number can be zero.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One copy, from USB transfer buffers to the frame buffers in the
</I>&gt;<i> driver, which can be mmap()'ed to the user application. How can the
</I>&gt;<i> number of copies be zero (or did i misunderstand your question)?.
</I>
You can make the USB controller do DMA directly to the user space
buffers, by using them as the transfer buffers. This is what V4L was
designed for, because some years ago, there wasn't much chance that the
PC would be able to handle all the streaming PAL video from a bttv card
if it were to be copied around.

Of course, some bridges (or standards) supply the video data in a stupid
format with headers, which need to be removed to concatenate the
individual chunks into a continuous picture. Then, most likely,
zero-copy is not possible.

But those that deliver the whole frame in a Bulk transfer without any
interfering headers, it's trivially possible to avoid the copy. (Yes,
I've done that. I needed it to be able to reach 60fps with a
ovfx2/ov7620 camera. Not using V4L2 yet, though.)
