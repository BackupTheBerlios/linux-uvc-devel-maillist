<PRE>Hi,
 see attached for a svn diff. Be aware that I've not much idea what I'm 
doing with this code, blindly fumbling in the dark at the moment, so I'm 
certainly not advocating what I've changed! The changes do make the 
camera load though.
&gt;<i> Having a look at the descriptors, the device shouldn't require an entry in the USB IDs list.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I added it to the list so it would have the UVC_QUIRK_PROBE_MINMAX, 
without it it doesn't get far at all. It seems the camera just doesn't 
support GET_DEF.
&gt;<i> There is a command line capture program called uvccapture, you could try it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Excellent, that's just the kind of thing I was looking for. So the light 
on the camera comes on and stays on but it seems like uvccapture is 
hanging. Ctrl-c doesn't kill it but disconnecting the camera does. This 
is the command line and the error I get, before pulling out the cable:
./uvccapture -x640 -y480 -t0
ioctl querycontrol error 22

This is the dmesg output up to the disconnect:

[17260296.440000] uvcvideo: Trying format 0x47504a4d (MJPG): 10000x10000.
[17260296.440000] uvcvideo: Using default frame interval 133333.3 us (7.5 fps).
[17260298.644000] uvcvideo: Trying format 0x47504a4d (MJPG): 10000x10000.
[17260298.644000] uvcvideo: Using default frame interval 133333.3 us (7.5 fps).
[17260826.716000] uvcvideo: Trying format 0x47504a4d (MJPG): 640x480.
[17260826.716000] uvcvideo: Using default frame interval 33333.3 us (30.0 fps).
[17260826.772000] uvcvideo: Control 0x00980913 not found.
[17260849.252000] usb 5-2: USB disconnect, address 33

I've not had a chance to look into the ioctl error or the control error 
yet. I can't really play too much with this at work. I'll look into it 
soon though.
&gt;<i> What happens when you run Ekiga ? The dmesg log doesn't show anything wrong. I 
</I>&gt;<i> assume it fails, but you didn't give any error message or failure 
</I>&gt;<i> description.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Nothing really. No errors anywhere I can find. No video either, just the 
icon moving up and down in the video panel. Basically it's not too 
helpful at all.
&gt;<i> However, the camera supports MJPEG only. It can't stream YUV images.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>So I'm guessing that means it won't work with that gstreamer line then? 
I'll stick to uvccapture for now, it's simple and I like that. I'll look 
at other programs once that works.

By the way, the button on the camera is found and I get messages in 
dmesg when it's pressed. The mic works well too.

Thanks,
 James.
