</I>
I'm afraid I'm a little out of my depth here; I don't think there's
anything in aMSN to tell me that it's working in MJPEG. All I know is that
before (ie. with the Debian testing version of aMSN - &quot;0.95+dfsg2-0.1&quot;) I
got an &quot;error getting capabilities&quot; from aMSN when I tried to open the
webcam. Someone else reported on the list that aMSN has added MJPEG
support into it, so I got a SVN snapshot the other night and built it. I
can't tell you what version I got, I'm afraid - The aMSN in my source dir
suggests it is 0.96RC1, whereas the aMSN about box suggests its version
0.97b, but even that is a bit old. So it's a snapshot from about a week
ago, and I apologise for not being more specific. 

Anyway, this version does work with my webcam, but crashes intermittently.
This is output from one aMSN session, from startup to it segfaulting: 


attempt to provide package tls 1.5 failed: package tls 1.50 provided instead
bplay: /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
[snip 8 lines of this]
bplay: /dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
Unsupported marker type 0x1b
Oops: malloc_video_bufs is 1 (expected 0) [utils/linux/capture/libng/grab-ng.c:malloc_bufs_check:231]
Oops: processes is 1 (expected 0) [utils/linux/capture/libng/convert.c:process_check:179]

ioctl: VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL(id=134217739;type=unknown;name=&quot;&quot;;minimum=0;maximum=0;step=0;default_value=0;flags=0): Input/output error

The &quot;device or resource busy&quot; is aMSN saying &quot;I wanted to play a sound but
you're listening to music, so I can't.&quot; If this isn't the same error as
you were considering before, I suspect they are both present but this is
the one that causes the crash. 


&gt;<i> 2. If so, what JPEG decoder does aMSN use?
</I>
I'm afraid tcl is not a language I've touched before (aMSN is a tcl
program) but as far as I can tell it's using the libng code by Gerd Knorr.


If there's more I can do to help, do let me know.
