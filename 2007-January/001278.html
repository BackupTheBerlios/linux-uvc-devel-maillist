<PRE>Hi James,

&gt;<i>  see attached for a svn diff. Be aware that I've not much idea what I'm
</I>&gt;<i> doing with this code, blindly fumbling in the dark at the moment, so I'm
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not advocating what I've changed! The changes do make the
</I>&gt;<i> camera load though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having a look at the descriptors, the device shouldn't require an entry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the USB IDs list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I added it to the list so it would have the UVC_QUIRK_PROBE_MINMAX,
</I>&gt;<i> without it it doesn't get far at all. It seems the camera just doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> support GET_DEF.
</I>
Nice to know. The Apple iSight was high on the list of broken cams, but it 
seems the Microsoft ones might beat it :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; There is a command line capture program called uvccapture, you could try
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Excellent, that's just the kind of thing I was looking for. So the light
</I>&gt;<i> on the camera comes on and stays on but it seems like uvccapture is
</I>&gt;<i> hanging. Ctrl-c doesn't kill it but disconnecting the camera does. This
</I>&gt;<i> is the command line and the error I get, before pulling out the cable:
</I>&gt;<i> ./uvccapture -x640 -y480 -t0
</I>&gt;<i> ioctl querycontrol error 22
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the dmesg output up to the disconnect:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [17260296.440000] uvcvideo: Trying format 0x47504a4d (MJPG): 10000x10000.
</I>&gt;<i> [17260296.440000] uvcvideo: Using default frame interval 133333.3 us (7.5
</I>&gt;<i> fps). [17260298.644000] uvcvideo: Trying format 0x47504a4d (MJPG):
</I>&gt;<i> 10000x10000. [17260298.644000] uvcvideo: Using default frame interval
</I>&gt;<i> 133333.3 us (7.5 fps). [17260826.716000] uvcvideo: Trying format 0x47504a4d
</I>&gt;<i> (MJPG): 640x480. [17260826.716000] uvcvideo: Using default frame interval
</I>&gt;<i> 33333.3 us (30.0 fps). [17260826.772000] uvcvideo: Control 0x00980913 not
</I>&gt;<i> found.
</I>&gt;<i> [17260849.252000] usb 5-2: USB disconnect, address 33
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've not had a chance to look into the ioctl error or the control error
</I>&gt;<i> yet. I can't really play too much with this at work. I'll look into it
</I>&gt;<i> soon though.
</I>
The control shouldn't be an issue. It just means the camera doesn't implement 
V4L2_CID_GAIN.

&gt;<i> &gt; What happens when you run Ekiga ? The dmesg log doesn't show anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrong. I assume it fails, but you didn't give any error message or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; failure description.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nothing really. No errors anywhere I can find. No video either, just the
</I>&gt;<i> icon moving up and down in the video panel. Basically it's not too
</I>&gt;<i> helpful at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, the camera supports MJPEG only. It can't stream YUV images.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'm guessing that means it won't work with that gstreamer line then?
</I>&gt;<i> I'll stick to uvccapture for now, it's simple and I like that. I'll look
</I>&gt;<i> at other programs once that works.
</I>
Could you raise the trace level to 255 (modprobe uvcvideo trace=255) ? The 
driver should get much more verbose then.

&gt;<i> By the way, the button on the camera is found and I get messages in
</I>&gt;<i> dmesg when it's pressed. The mic works well too.
</I>
So the only working features are either unusable (the button currently logs a 
message but doesn't do anything else) or out of the Linux UVC driver scope 
(audio is handled by the USB audio driver). Nice :-)

Cheers,

Laurent Pinchart
