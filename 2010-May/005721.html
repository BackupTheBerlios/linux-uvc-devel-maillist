I have two solutions that I've come up with this so far.
1) Modify the uvc_video.c to queue urbs in a list in the urb completion 
handler.  A driver level semaphore controls the number of currently 
submitting cameras.  You can adjust the initial sem_count in 
uvc_driver.c.  Ideally, that would be a module parameter but I'm just 
getting things to work.

I found capture speeds quite a bit slower than I'd like with this method 
though.  I can capture with 8 cameras at 10 FPS without overwhelming the 
ISO bus but if I change to 15 FPS I can only capture with 3 cameras at a 
time.  Adding the patch, I then can configure and capture from all 8 
cameras running at 15 FPS but only submitting URBs for 3 at a time. 
Depending on how many frames I let those cameras capture I got captured 
frame rates from around 4 to 6.

I'm attaching the patch in case anyone wants to play with this or 
suggest ways to improve it.  One thing I had a problem with is that it 
seems some of the capture images are corrupted.  This patch was against 
2.6.27.2.  A little old I know but I'm working on an embedded device.

2) I modified ehci-sched.c to not raise the ENOSPC error.  That solution 
actually lets me capture on all 8 cameras at 15 FPS.  This has other 
implications though and I'm not sure it is a very good solution.  It 
does tell me that perhaps the Linux ISO scheduler could perhaps use look 
through.  One major discrepancy is that bandwidth is allocated based on 
the max packet size I think but for my compressed images (MJPG) each 
frame is only a fraction of the max allocated bandwidth.
