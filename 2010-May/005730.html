Most definitely a hack.  I just included it because someone had 
expressed interest in the solution.  If there was a way to do it faster, 
it might be a good thing to pursue but I can't think of a good way to 
synchronize the frames in such a way to not lose a lot of each frame 
(like you mentioned in your other response) after continuing urb 
submission and waste a lot of transfer bandwidth.

</I>

The camera is definitely selecting more bandwidth than it needs.  The 
size of each image does vary when I'm streaming MJPG images.  It is 
usually somewhere along the lines of 110-150K at maximum resolution 
(1280x1024 for these cameras).
Perhaps this is the problem with these cameras:
Here is the information from the Uncompressed video format descriptor 
for the 1280x1024 YUYV data:
dwMaxVideoFrameBufferSize 2621440
And here is the information returned from the MJPG descriptor for the 
same sized compressed image:
dwMaxVideoFrameBufferSize 2621440

Logitech C500 by the way.

&gt;<i> If the camera request an alternate setting that isn't the smallest, you might
</I>&gt;<i> try to experiment with hardcoding a lower bandwidth in uvc_video_init.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think I actually tried that a while back when I first started playing 
with this issue.  If I recall, selecting a lower bandwidth interface 
caused a mismatch between the information in each packets and the 
placement of the frame headers in the UVC protocol.  Result was it never 
dequeued a buffer.  I'm not sure that isn't worth investigating further 
though.  I may have done something wrong.

Thank for your analysis of this.  Helps to have more than just my eyes 
look over the issue.

In the mean time, I'm having quite good luck with my EHCI hack.  I just 
let all the ISO frames through and I get all the images from all 8 
cameras back at 15 FPS.  I may come back to this problem before I'm all 
the way finished and see if there is a way to button this up cleaner but 
temporarily the solution is working for me.
