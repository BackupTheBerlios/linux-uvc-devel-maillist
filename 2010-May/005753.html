</I>
The uvcvideo driver requests bandwidth based on values reported by the camera.

There are two settings involved there. The first one is the alternate settings 
for the video streaming interface. The video streaming interface has an 
isochronous endpoint for video streaming, and each alternate setting has a 
different maximum packet size for the endpoint, resulting in different 
bandwidth requirements.

The second one is the dwMaxPayloadTransferSize value reported by the camera 
when querying its video streaming control. The driver selects the alternate 
setting with the lowest bandwidth that fulfills the dwMaxPayloadTransferSize 
requirements.

If your camera has a single alternate setting (this can be checked using 
lsusb) you're probably screwed, as the bandwidth is fixed. If it has multiple 
alternate settings, it might be requesting a bandwidth higher than what it 
really needs. In that case you could try to hardcode a lower bandwidth (see 
the uvc_init_video function in uvc_video.c), or let the driver compute a 
bandwidth estimation on its own by setting the UVC_QUIRK_FIX_BANDWIDTH quirk.

It's also possible to play with URB submission order to use higher bandwidths 
and alternate capture between the different webcams. Dennis Muhlestein 
investigated that and got interesting results. Search the list archives for a 
thread called &quot;Multiple camera framerate&quot;.

&gt;<i> In the second case can we force the driver on the allocation problem if it
</I>&gt;<i> is in the driver ?
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know yet the answer to this - and having a few
</I>&gt;<i> pointers/explanations from the UVC implementors might help here !
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I saw the other forums and their approach - and somebody proposed there
</I>
